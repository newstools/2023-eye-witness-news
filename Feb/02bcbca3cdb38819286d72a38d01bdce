JOHANNESBURG - Eskom said that outgoing spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha helped improve the ailing power utility's public image during a difficult period. Mantshantsha is parting ways with the crumbling parastatal, with his three-year fixed-term contract coming to an end on Tuesday. Eskom said that the candid spokesperson spearheaded the utility's efforts to increase accountability and transparency among the South African public, while many would remember him as the bearer of bad news. "Eskom regrets to inform the public… Eskom apologises for the inconvenience… Eskom does apologise for the inconvenience," he subsequently became known for saying.
