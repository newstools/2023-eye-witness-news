JOHANNESBURG - While there's been expectation from some that former Gauteng Premier David Makhura would be headed into President Cyril Ramaphosa's office, the African National Congress (ANC) has instead deployed him to its Luthuli House headquarters on a full-time basis. Eyewitness News understands that Makhura, Mduduzi Manana, and Mdumiseni Ntuli, who lost out on the race to become the secretary-general of the governing party last year, were deployed to help firm up Luthuli House. The deployments followed a special national executive committee meeting wherein the ANC finalised its subcommittees and deployed different NEC members across the country.
