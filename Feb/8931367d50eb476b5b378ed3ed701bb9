JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says theft and vandalism of its infrastructure left mine workers in Randfontein trapped underground. The utility said it had to dispatch a team of technicians to Sibanye Gold Mine earlier this week, after employees could not resurface due to a power supply interruption. Theft and vandalism compromised the local power lines. The miners were safely evacuated after power supply to the mine was restored. Eskom Gauteng spokesperson Amanda Qithi said the incident was economically devastating. "Theft of tower members leads to the instability and collapse of pylons that carry high voltage power lines, which then poses a safety risk on members of the public. This criminal practice has an additionally devastating impact on the economy. “We spend a fortune replacing stolen pylon parts and other equipment."   A collapsed electricity pylon.

Gauteng maintenance and operations senior manager Mashangu Xivambu appealed to the public to report illegal connections, theft, and vandalism. “We recently reported that vandalism and theft have extended to include pylons whose tower members are often stolen by unscrupulous criminal elements, resulting in the steel structures collapsing. “It is disturbing that this incident happens a week after we raised a concern about incidents of theft and vandalism of pylons,” Xivambu said.
