CAPE TOWN - ANC deputy president Paul Mashatile was expected to be among four governing party leaders to be sworn in as new members of Parliament on Monday. This would pave the way for President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint Mashatile as his new deputy. This follows incumbent David Mabuza announcing publicly over the weekend that he no longer wished to retain his job.
