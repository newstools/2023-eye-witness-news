Other areas affected by power cuts include Tshwane, Govan Mbeki, and Lesedi which are also seeing their water supply being affected. Despite the weeks of heavy rains, Rand Water says its reservoir levels are still affected. â€œTechnicians from the City of Ekurhuleni checked their systems, and no faults were found. Eskom technicians are now busy with fault findings and unfortunately, the estimated restoration time is still unknown," said spokesperson Makenosi Maroo.
