For him, he was just in the moment saying goodbye to Tibs for the night and someone comes and shoots him from the back. So it's extremely painful, it's an image that will stay with the family for very long." Baloyi speculated that the attack was planned. "You can tell just by looking at the video that this was intended for him it was not a robbery they didn't attempt to take anything."
