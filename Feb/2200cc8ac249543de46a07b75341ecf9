Police added that in similar cases, criminals were operating in hotspots including Soweto, Tembisa, the Johannesburg Central Business District (CBD) and Pretoria. People should be extra vigilant of the type of information that they shared with the general public - whether it be on Facebook, Instagram, or a WhatsApp status - because that was where suspects and criminals were looking for their next target. “We know that they've arrested more than 100 suspects. Eighty-one of them are still in police custody. They were arrested on charges of kidnapping and extortion and other related crimes,” police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said about the scope of cases. Meanwhile, Grindr also issued a warning to the users of the app to be cautious when using the app.
