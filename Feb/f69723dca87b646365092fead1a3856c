CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Wednesday served Parliament with a letter of demand to find a suitable venue for the National Assembly to conduct its business - while the rebuilding of the precinct continues. The DA made the demand a day before President Cyril Ramaphosa delivers his second State of the Nation Address (Sona) at the Cape Town City Hall following the devastating fire in January 2022. Opposition parties said they also expect fewer promises from Ramaphosa's Sona speech.

DA Chief Whip Siviwe Gwarubu said R2 billion was allocated for the rebuilding, and that Parliament had enough time to find an alternative venue. “This R8 million bill that has been allocated to hosting Sona debate and budget speech could have been avoided had Parliament had its own alternative venue where they could have their own equipment that needs not be hired. And this is why we’ve given them 14 days to provide us with a timeline."
