Sphelo Samuel a whistleblower to Parliament, was the third witness before the inquiry last July, when the section 194 committee heard about his assault conviction involving Nchaupe Seabi.

Fielding questions from MPs, Caroline Zulu-Sokoni sad it was too early to say whether Mkhwebane’s impeachment inquiry was a fair process. "There are these little issues that have to be resolved to ensure the Public Protector feels she’s getting a fair process before this committee. but we will keep a watching brief on the proceedings going on here," she said. Zulu-Sokoni said attempts to remove Mkhwebane should not be based on trumped-up charges. "The charges being brought against the ombudsman must not be because the executive is unhappy with the ombudsman." Zulu-Sokoni says the reason why Mkhwebane has faced so many court challenges, is because of the binding nature of her findings.
