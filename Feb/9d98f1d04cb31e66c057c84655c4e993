Chikunga said should investigations reveal that the crash was a result of negligence, her department would ensure a criminal case is opened. She said the RTMC was urged to treat the investigation with urgency. While reports suggested the bus was unroadworthy, Chikunga said this was yet to be confirmed. "We are investigating, and based on our findings, we will then decide whether there is a case to answer to in court."
