The city's safety and security mayoral committee member JP Smith said they noticed a growing trend as more people visit the city’s beaches. Smith said the two suspected thieves arrested were among 310 suspects arrested over the past week. He said residents should always take note of their surroundings. “The day at the beach is meant to be relaxing, but this incident proves that criminals don't take a day off. Beware of your surroundings - even while you are enjoying the sand and the surf."
