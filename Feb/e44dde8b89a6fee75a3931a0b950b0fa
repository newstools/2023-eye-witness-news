CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Education Department and police have agreed on a plan of action following minibus taxi blockades preventing learners from getting to school. The department said the action has prevented over 5,000 children from attending class in Khayelitsha and neighbouring areas. Education MEC David Maynier said contracted scholar transport drivers  were being threatened and taxi associations falsely claiming they were promised contracts by his department without following tender processes. It is unacceptable that the illegal blockade by minibus taxi associations escalated yesterday, with over 5 000 learners being prevented from attending school in Khayelitsha and neighbouring areas.Read more here: https://t.co/ngcFeaAZGT pic.twitter.com/3cncvaKOvj
