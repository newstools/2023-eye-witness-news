CAPE TOWN - Parliament said it had taken all steps possible to ensure that Thursday’s State of the Nation Address (Sona) was not disrupted by load shedding. Parliament was expected to host the Sona at Cape Town City Hall this year following last year’s fire, with all the usual pomp and ceremony now that COVID-19 restrictions had been lifted.
