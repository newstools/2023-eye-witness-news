Warning: This story contains graphic details about child rape and abuse. JOHANNESBURG - The Johannesburg High Court has revoked the bail of alleged child sex offender Gerhard Ackerman. An inquiry into Ackerman’s disappearance and rearrest at the weekend was heard in the court on Wednesday. When an urgent warrant of arrest for Ackerman was issued on Friday, it was under the premise that he had violated his bail conditions. On Monday, Ackerman argued that his bail conditions had been amended - something State Advocate Valencia Dube denied. But on Wednesday, Dube rose to tell the court that upon inquiry, it seemed Ackerman’s bail conditions were in fact amended in December, without her knowledge, in the Johannesburg Magistrates Court. This means his move to Pretoria was above board.

He also considered other facts before him, including testimony that he was planning to flee to the Western Cape or Botswana, and that he was looking for a firearm to take his own life. The matter continues in the high court, where one of the victim’s parents has taken the witness stand. He faces 740 counts of crimes ranging from rape and human trafficking to the distribution of child pornography. Ackerman is alleged to run a child sex ring in Johannesburg, where he would lure teenage boys in and link them with adult men who would require massages that would escalate to rape.
