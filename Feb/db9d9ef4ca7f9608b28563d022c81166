JOHANNESBURG - The state will consider a plea bargain proposal by the man accused of murdering Tembisa Hospital nurse, Lebo Monene. 33-year-old Constable Lucky Mudau is accused of driving into the Tembisa Hospital parking lot exactly a year ago and shooting Monene, who was his girlfriend. He then shot himself, leading to paralysis from the neck down.

He was brought to court in a wheelchair when he attended each hearing in the high court in Johannesburg. Meanwhile, Monene’s family mourned the first anniversary of her death. Her father Nicholas said he hoped Mudau’s health condition did not prevent him from serving out a prison sentence. The matter returns to court next month.
