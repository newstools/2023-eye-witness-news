CAPE TOWN - Civil society groups on Thursday called for an end to load shedding and Eskomâ€™s 18.65% electricity tariff increase that will take effect from April 2023. This came ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa's sixth State of the Nation Address on Thursday. Western Cape South African Communist Party chairperson Benson Nqentsu said that they expect clear and actionable plans aimed at resolving the power crisis from the president's speech. "Because to us, the energy crisis is nothing but economic sabotage. The energy crisis and the state of rail are two sides of the same coin because both serve as economic sabotage," said Nqentsu. He added that Ramaphosa must explain to the country how his government plans to tackle crime, high unemployment and the country's failing infrastructure.

Moreover, the organisations called on the president not to rehash what they referred to as "old empty promises" made in his previous addresses. They want Ramaphosa to tell the country how his government plans to alleviate poverty and tackle the issue of inequality.
