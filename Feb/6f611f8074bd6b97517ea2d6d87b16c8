PRETORIA - The Speaker of Tshwane, Dr Murunwa Makwarela, said there are councillors within the coalition government who want him removed from his position. Makwarela, a Congress of the People (Cope) councillor, said he is aware that there are members from the Democratic Alliance (DA)-led multiparty coalition who intend to submit a motion of no confidence in him over his handling of now former mayor Randall Williams’s resignation. READ: Tshwane mayor Randall Williams resigns Williams initially resigned on 13 February, but later submitted an amended resignation letter that said his resignation would be effective on 28 February. Following pressure from opposition councillors, Makwarela ordered an external legal opinion that found that Williams's amendment was unlawful. READ: Tshwane without mayor after legal opinion rejects Williams' amended resignation Makwarela said he has handled the situation to the best of his ability. “There are always motions of no confidence in the city, but it is regrettable when you hear from your own coalition partners who are planning such kind of an act behind one’s back. It is quite alarming, but we are not phased.” My speaking notes from today's media briefing on the legal opinion on the Mayor's resignation. pic.twitter.com/VUnDQXYo3D
