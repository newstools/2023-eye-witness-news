JOHANNESBURG - The Turkish government has arrested more than 180 people in connection with the tens of thousands of collapsed buildings following the recent Turkiye-Syria earthquake and aftershocks. In Turkiye alone, around 160, 000 apartment buildings either collapsed or were badly damaged, resulting in more than 44 thousand deaths. More than two million people are believed to have been left homeless.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is up for re-election in June, promised there would be accountability.
