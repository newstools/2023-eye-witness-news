READ: 1,000 days later & families of trapped Lily Mine workers feel betrayed by govt There were initially search and rescue missions to retrieve the remains of Yvonne Mnisi, Pretty Nkambule, and Solomon Nyirenda, but this was later abandoned. Mashaba said he would ask the mine's business rescue practitioners to allow the families of the three employees access to the mine. "Do you remember when they set up sites, they had a court order refusing them into the mine. They said they must be at least one kilometre away from the mine".
