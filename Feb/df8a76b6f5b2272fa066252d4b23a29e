READ: Teen killed, 5-year-old injured in Manenberg drive-by shooting The teenager died before he could receive medical attention. Authorities called on residents in the Manenberg community to come forward with information that could lead to an arrest. “It was very shocking and appalling that a five-year-old has been caught in the crossfire," said the Manenberg Community Policing Forum's Pedro Visagie. "However, the circumstances are not that unusual in that the little kid followed his uncle, who was the target, and hence, when the shooting occurred, the kid was present.”
