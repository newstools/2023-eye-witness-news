CAPE TOWN - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) on Wednesday revealed that it's planning a seven-day strike for next month. The trade union federation, joined by affiliates, gathered in Cape Town to voice their demands ahead of Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana’s budget speech. Union members were gathering just under a kilometre away from the Cape Town City Hall, where Godongwana is set to outline the government’s financial outlook for the next financial year.  Cosatu's first deputy president, Mike Shingange, elaborated on some of their demands. "We are here to display our dissatisfaction with the government, how they've handled the public service impact, particularly on the collective bargaining. You'll remember that we have the dispute of 2022 with government, which while we were at conciliation they left us and came to Parliament and unilaterally implemented the 3% [wage hike]. We are still in that dispute now." READ: Public service unions differ on fight over wages Shingange said that they will be serving a notice to strike on Wednesday. "We've got a certificate since last year, we are definitely going to file for seven days' notice that's going to shut down the public service in the country." Meanwhile, many South Africans are looking to the government for some reprieve from the economic chokehold they’re in.
