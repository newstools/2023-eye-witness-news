JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) said on Tuesday it had been tipped off by police that senior Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leaders were plotting to assassinate its secretary-general, Marshall Dlamini. The EFF claimed a police report suggested the yet-to-be-identified IFP leaders believed Dlamini was spearheading motions of no confidence against all IFP mayors in KwaZulu-Natal. READ: EFF cutting ties with IFP in KZN nothing major, assures party Last week, EFF leader Julius Malema told the media that his party would no longer be supporting the IFP. EFF spokesperson Leigh-Ann Mathys said the party did not want to be subjected to politically motivated killings that were prevalent in KZN. She said the EFF had put in place security measures to ensure Dlamini's safety. "We will also launch our own internal investigations because we can't always rely on law enforcement. It's a very political hostile world out there," said Mathys. IFP RESPONDS The IFP shot down the EFF’s accusation, with president Velinkosi Hlabisa urging police to capitalise on the information they reportedly tipped to the EFF by arresting the leaders said to be plotting Dlamini's murder. Hlabisa questioned the validity of the information. He asked why the police had not taken any action on the alleged assassination plot. He said the IFP would write a letter to the police service requesting them to release more details on the alleged assassination plot. “We cannot run to the public and confuse it and make allegations, yet we have police who have the information.” Hlabisa said the EFF was seeking public sympathy by publicising the matter  amid coalition disputes. The two parties fell out due to failed power-sharing talks in some KwaZulu-Natal municipalities governed through coalitions.
