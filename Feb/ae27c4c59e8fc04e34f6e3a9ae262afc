JOHANNESBURG - Hundreds of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members have gathered outside the Gauteng Department of Health Department, demanding that all children be allocated to schools. The party is claiming that about 2,000 children in the province have not found a school yet. However, the education department is disputing this figure. EFF provincial leader Nkululeko Dunga said the party had received complaints from parents saying their children were sitting at home and not going to school. “It is an unconstitutional thing for any student to not have a basic right to free and quality education, and that is what we are moving with as the EFF, and why we are here.” [PICTURES] The EFF in Gauteng held a picket outside the Gauteng Department of Education offices in Johannesburg.
