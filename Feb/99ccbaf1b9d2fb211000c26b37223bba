JOHANNESBURG - Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said he would consider an application to recuse himself from President Cyril Ramaphosaâ€™s application to the Constitutional Court to set aside the Section 89 panel report on Phala Phala should a formal request be submitted. The chief justice was speaking at the presentation of the judiciary's annual report for 2021/22 at the Constitutional Court in Johannesburg on Friday. "I don't know if there is anybody who would like me not to sit in such a matter if it was to be heard, but I don't want to pre-judge what will happen when an application is made. So, if [or] when there is an application made for me to recuse myself I will consider it at that time and take a position," said Zondo.
