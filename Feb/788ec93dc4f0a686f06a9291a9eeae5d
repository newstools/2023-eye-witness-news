Van der Linde said that he was a huge of fan of efforts to get as many driver and diversity programs off the ground. “Me and my younger brother, Sheldon, we’ve tried our best to also act as the face of motorsport and show the younger kids that it is possible to come from a South African background and make it on an international stage. “I think that it’s a goal for the young guys, it’s a cool thing and, yeah, it’s up to our government and Motorsport South Africa to keep pushing and, as I said, hopefully, we’ve got some more African involvement.” The racing driver said that he was stoked to be driving in front of a home crowd. “It’s huge for South Africa to have a world championship here in the Mother City - it’s a beautiful backdrop. “I think if we can pull off a great event this weekend, with lots of spectators, it’s a sign to the rest of the world and a sign to Formula 1 that we need Formula 1back in the country.”
