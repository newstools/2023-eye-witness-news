CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) and taxi association, Codeta, will square up at the Western Cape High Court on Friday over the scholar transport impasse. The department wants the court to compel Codeta to stop the blockade of its contracted learner transport. Meanwhile, Codeta wants the department to consider it for scholar transport contracts.

The Western Cape Education Department is accusing Codeta of reneging on its promise not to intimidate, threaten, or prevent learners from being transported in Khayelitsha and Mfuleni. Last Friday, Codeta undertook to suspend their blockade, pending the outcome of the court case. But provincial education MEC David Maynier said their contracted drivers were harassed this week, resulting in 1,800 pupils missing school on Monday. However, Codeta's Andile Khanyi said they could not have prevented the scholar transport knowing there was a court case pending on the matter. "That issue is at the court at the moment, our legal team is working on it." Codeta said it was ready for Friday's court hearing.
