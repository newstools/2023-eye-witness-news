JOHANNESBURG - The case against Bokgabo Poo's alleged killer has been referred to the director of public prosecutions for a decision on which court the matter is to be heard in. Ntokozo Zikhali, his face covered with a surgical mask, appeared briefly in the Benoni Magistrates Court on Tuesday in connection with the kidnapping, rape and murder of four-year-old Poo in October last year. Prosecutor Elizabeth Bisi informed the court that a decision needed to be made on whether the trial will be heard in a regional or high court. The matter was postponed to 30 March for a decision. Poo's mother, Tsholo, was clear about where she wanted the trial to be heard. "I can only hope that they decide to take the case to the high court for a proper trial." Poo had been singing outside court with members of the Wattville community, who came out in their numbers to support the family.
