JOHANNESBURG - Joburg City Power said it had managed to collect R3 billion in revenue in the last three months from residents and businesses who had defaulted on their accounts. The utility on Wednesday embarked on a cut-off electricity operation in Roodepoort, targeting properties with illegal power connections. This formed part of the municipality’s revenue collection drive which has since cut off supply to properties in Roodepoort, Lenasia South and Alexandra. ALSO READ:  City Power’s CEO Tshifularo Mashava said it was concerning that some businesses only paid their electricity bills after the supply was cut off. She said the utility had collected R5.4 million in the last two days after threatening to take action against indebted property owners. "So it is quite clear that these customers have the ability to pay for services and that is why we are disappointing them." The utility urged those in debt to settle their electricity bills as the lack of payment affects its financial position. This comes after some political parties lashed out at the City of Johannesburg for its poor revenue collection models stating that it had contributed to the metro’s financial crisis. All the properties that were targeted during Wednesday’s electricity supply cut-off operation were small and medium enterprises in Roodepoort, whose accounts are in arrears. Mashava said most of these businesses are financially capable of paying their electricity bills on a monthly basis. She added that while action was taken against those who were refusing to pay for services, it was important to educate small, medium and micro enterprises and big companies about the effects of the non-payment culture. "We don't want to disconnect because disconnecting and reconnecting costs us money. We just want the customers to pay their bills on time." Last year, the capital city embarked on the #TshwaneYaTima campaign that targeted businesses that had been owing millions of rands in electricity bills.
