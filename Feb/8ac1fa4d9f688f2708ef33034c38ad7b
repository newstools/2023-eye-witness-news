After this primary vaccination range, they can now also present for a booster dose. Alyssa du Preez decided to have her four-year-old daughter, Ryleigh du Preez, inoculated against the viral disease when they visited the clinic on Wednesday. “It [vaccination] is important cause they move a lot of places and even they go to creches they communicate with a lot of kids there. Health is more important first of all.” READ: Measles outbreak has spread to 5 provinces - NICD Mbombo said no outbreak has been detected in the province, but five measles cases locally have been picked up. “We are appealing to everyone to bring the children for immunisation for measles… but now we’re giving them the booster dose, so it’s a reflection that the coverage is very low… probably due to the pandemic that some of the children ended up not coming for the immunisation.” Measles outbreaks have been declared in the Free State, Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West.
