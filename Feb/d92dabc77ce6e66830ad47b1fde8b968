CAPE TOWN - Social movements under the banner of Cry of the Xcluded Forum said they will take out their frustrations at the general elections in 2024 if the government doesn't meet their demands. A small crowd gathered in front of Parliament to convey their grievances to the government on Tuesday. Their demonstration took place on the eve of Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana's budget speech. The protesters said their demands are clear: the creation of decent jobs for the unemployed, an end to load shedding, the provision of decent housing for the poor and the delivery of services in impoverished communities.

"We're saying to our people in the ANC next year it's elections. We still want to vote for you but what are we voting for if our lives are deteriorating the way they're deteriorating." Peoples Health Movement's Sindiswa Godwana added that the government also needs to improve the health system in the townships.

Mngomezulu received a memorandum of demands from the protesting social movement groups outside Parliament. While accepting the memorandum, Mngomezulu said communities need to tell the government exactly what they want. "We need people like yourselves leadership, who take the concerns of the community and march to the relevant institutions so that you're heard." Back 2 Work campaign's Lumka Kawuta added that the exploitation of Expanded Public Works Programme workers needs to stop.
