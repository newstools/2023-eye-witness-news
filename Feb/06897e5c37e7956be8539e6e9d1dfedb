JOHANNESBURG - South African Tourism (SAT) has called for a distinction between using funds for service delivery and tourism. The entity defended its almost R1 billion project to sponsor the English football team Tottenham Hotspur. SAT said that the deal was conditionally approved and will be presented to stakeholders such as Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu and National Treasury.

SAT acting CEO Themba Khumalo addressed the notion that almost a billion rand in sponsorship funds could be better used to address the country's challenges. "The money that's invested in tourism is not the same money that's required for energy. It's not the same amount that is required for potholes. The are other departments that are dedicated and are given that mandate by legislation our legislative mandate is about persuading international people to travel into the country and spend money on our economy and that is what we will stick to." But he insisted the deal will positively influence South Africa's social landscape. "It's a solid business case that has got a direct impact in terms of foreign  investment that comes into the country that is able to create jobs then sustain SMMEs and be able to return the dignity of a better life to our people around South Africa." The entity is forging ahead with the deal  and engagements with leaders in government will determine the way forward. READ: SA tourism's proposed r1bn deal with Tottenham Hotspur: sane or irrational?
