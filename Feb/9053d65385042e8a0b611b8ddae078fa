TSHWANE - The water crisis in the city of Tshwane reached boiling point on Wednesday as residents in Soshanguve protested over the shortages. They blocked several roads near the Aubrey Matlala intersection with burning tyres, rocks, and debris. Residents said they’d been without water for four weeks after Rand Water throttled its supply to the metro, and they had had enough. The community said the situation had worsened with the country currently on Stage 5 load shedding. #TshwaneWaterCuts Residents say they’ve been without for four weeks.
