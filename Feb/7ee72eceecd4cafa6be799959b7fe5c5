"The energy crisis in South Africa cannot be fixed by any one partner, it cannot be fixed by government, it cannot be fixed by the private sector, it requires a collaboration across the public/private ecosystem.” The City of Cape Town’s economic opportunities mayoral committee member, James Vos, was also present. He reiterated the importance of more investment in renewable energy sources, particularly solar energy. “There must be a consistent pipeline of skilled workers and businesses able to meet the demands of services and products of this sector, and so with an increased demand for solar panels, we can create job opportunities for millions of currently unemployed South Africans," Vos said.
