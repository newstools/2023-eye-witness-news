JOHANNESBURG - One of the African National Congress’ (ANC) newest members of Parliament (MPs), Maropene Ramokgopa, would not be drawn on whether she was destined to join President Cyril Ramaphosa's office. She said that her role was to serve as a link between the ANC’s Luthuli House headquarters and its deployees in government. Ramokgopa was one of four party members - including Paul Mashatile, who was likely to become South Africa's next deputy president - who were sworn in at Parliament on Monday.

However, the implementation and the performance of our own deployees would not necessarily be monitored if they are speaking to what the ANC has decided.”
