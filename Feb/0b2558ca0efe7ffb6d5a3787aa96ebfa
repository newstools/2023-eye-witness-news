CAPE TOWN - Social movements, labour unions and grassroots organisations protested outside Parliament on Tuesday. This came a day before Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana tables the national budget. The protesters said they're tired of empty promises from the government, and want the minister to table a budget that will benefit the poor and working-class people. The protesters, marching under the banner - Cry of the Xcluded forum - demand a clear plan on how the government plans to tackle the country's energy crisis, high unemployment, service delivery failures and gender-based violence - among other things.

Cuphe said they refuse to sit idly and watch their communities collapse.
