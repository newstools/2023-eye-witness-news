Responding to the concerns raised, he agreed that there were challenges in the metro, saying they were being attended to. “We acknowledged the challenges that the city is faced with. We’ve started to intervene, in terms of the cleanliness. Those who reside in the city can see the improvements, but we don’t want people to enjoy the improvements, we want them to see a change.” Kaunda vowed that Durban would return to its clean state with improved infrastructure.
