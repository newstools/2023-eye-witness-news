DURBAN - The South African Local Government Association (Salga) on Thursday said fears of corruption should not prevent the government from making available more money to the local government. Salga chairperson in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Thami Ntuli spoke to Eyewitness News ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday evening.

But Salga in the province wants the Sona to also focus on the finances needed at the local government level. As President Cyril Ramaphosa's Sona edged closer, the KZN Salga maintains the president must give more money to municipalities and that corruption allegations must not stop him. “So if more funds could be brought down to local government, there are fears of corruption  – with corruption there is no level of government that can say we are clean, no corruption," said Ntuli.
