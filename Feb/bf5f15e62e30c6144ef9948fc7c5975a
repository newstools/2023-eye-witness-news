JOHANNESBURG - ActionSA in Joburg has expressed concern over the hypocrisy of the African National Congress (ANC) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)  accusing them of serving their own political interests before those of the residents of the city.

The ANC and EFF rejected the same loan proposal in council late last year - saying the metro will not be able to settle the short-term loan.

However, on Wednesday the same partnership believes the loan would be of good use to the city, even though it would have to be repaid by June as outlined in the Municipal Finance Management Act. Action SA's Sthembelo Majola said the party has written to the speaker requesting a detailed loan repayment plan. "ActionSA is now concerned that due to the delays in the approval of the loan, with only four months left before the end of the City of Johannesburg's financial year, the city will be unable to repay the loan." The ANC said the city desperately needs the loan.
