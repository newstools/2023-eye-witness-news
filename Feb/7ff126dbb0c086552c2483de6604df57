JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver his State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday night. The much-anticipated address gives Ramaphosa a chance to speak to South Africans about the state of the country, and to reflect on a wide range of political, economic, and social matters. The address usually takes place during February, and is presided over by the speaker and/or chairperson of the council, by arrangement between them. Sona is followed by a two-day debate on the address, and then the president is given an opportunity to reply to the debate on the third day, and to close the debate.

Ramaphosa will deliver his Sona before Parliament, as Parliament is charged with ensuring the work flowing from the address is implemented. Most importantly, Sona is delivered in Parliament because the priorities pronounced in it have budgetary implications demanding robust oversight – one of Parliament’s constitutional responsibilities. Parliament may accept, reject, or amend the allocation of budgets to government departments to ensure that these are in line with national priorities as outlined in the Sona. Parliament may also withhold the budgets of departments whose annual performance plans are not in line with these priorities. The session is referred to as the State of the Nation Address to distinguish it from the Opening Address, that usually occurs at the start of a term of Parliament. In practice, the terms Sona and Opening of Parliament are used interchangeably.

Section 84(2)(d) of the Constitution provides that the President may summon the National Assembly, the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), or Parliament to an extraordinary sitting to conduct special business. Joint Rule 7(1)(a) provides that the President may call a joint sitting of the Houses when it is necessary for the President to deliver the annual or a special address to Parliament. WHAT ARE THE CEREMONIALS FOR SONA? The official programme usually begins with three processions. There is the procession of provincial speakers, provincial premiers, and the judiciary proceeding to the assembly chamber through the main entrance of the National Assembly building. There is the arrival of the presidential cavalcade in the parliamentary precincts. The president alights, is welcomed by the presiding officers and their deputies, and proceeds to the National Assembly chamber. The aides-de-camp lead the presidential procession. READ: Zackie Achmat: there's no State of the Nation, only a 'state of destruction’ AIDES-DE-CAMP As the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, aides-de-camp are attached to the President of the Republic of South Africa at all ceremonies of the State. Their role in the country is limited to ceremonial duties. Once this task has been fulfilled, they are immediately withdrawn. During the Sona, they travel with the president from the president’s place of residence to Parliament. The aides-de-camp leads the presidential procession onto a saluting dais on the steps of the National Assembly to receive the ceremonial honours, the guard of honour by the National Ceremonial Guard, the 21-gun salute, the national anthem, and a salute flight. They then lead the procession into the chamber and stand guard at the entrance of the chamber. 21-GUN SALUTE In 1842, the 21-gun salute became the international norm as the highest honour a nation rendered, and is fired in honour of the president. The first shot of the salute is synchronised to coincide with the playing of the national anthem. The salute takes one minute and 40 seconds. IN THE CHAMBER Members of both Houses must be seated before the procession enters. Each of the nine provinces is represented by its full quota of six permanent and four rotating members, seated in the removable cross-benches. A delegation of 10 South African Local Government Association members also occupies seats in the cross-benches. Members’ guests, representatives of statutory and constitutional bodies, the judges president, provincial speakers, director-generals of state departments, guests from civil society approved by the presiding officers, and staff of the Presidency and Parliament are accommodated in the National Assembly galleries, the Officials’ Bays to the right and left of the speaker’s chair and in Room E249, and the Old Assembly chamber via a live audio-visual relay of the proceedings in the National Assembly chamber. The presiding officers and the president enter the chamber in procession, preceded by the serjeant-at-arms and the usher of the Black Rod, and followed by the secretary to Parliament. IMBONGI A new element of the Sona since the birth of democracy is Imbongi, the praise singer. Although our Parliament is based on the Westminster traditions, Imbongi praise singing gives Africanness pride of place, narrating the president’s personal history, clan, and family lineage in song, dance and narration. Imbongi starts this narration as the presidential procession enters the chamber. SERJEANT-AT-ARMS AND USHER OF THE BLACK ROD The serjeant-at-arms and the usher of the Black Rod are responsible for compliance with security policy in and around the chamber and galleries, and implement related instructions from the speaker, the chairperson of the NCOP, and other presiding officers. They also perform ceremonial functions, among others, leading the procession into the chamber at the start of proceedings. The serjeant-at-arms and the usher of the Black Rod lead the president and the presiding officers to their seats, and proceed to place the Mace and the Black Rod in place before the speaker and the chairperson of the NCOP, respectively. MACE AND BLACK ROD The Mace is a symbol of authority of the speaker of the National Assembly. When the serjeant-at-arms carries the Mace into the debating chamber and places it before the speaker of the National Assembly, it means the National Assembly is formally in session, and that its proceedings are official. The Mace was designed to reflect the history, traditions, and diverse cultures and languages of South Africa. The design also celebrates the country’s natural beauty, its plant and animal life and its rich mineral resources. The shape of the Mace recalls the knobkerrie, an African symbol of defence, as well as authority and leadership. Gold symbolises not only our country’s natural wealth, but also the indigenous knowledge of Africa and the ancient African gold mining traditions of Mapungubwe. The Black Rod is the symbol of the authority of the chairperson of the NCOP. The Black Rod reflects the important role of the provinces in the functioning of the NCOP. When the usher of the Black Rod carries the Black Rod into the debating chamber and places it before the chairperson of the NCOP, it means the NCOP is formally in session and that its proceedings are official. The shape of the Black Rod is in the form of a knobkerrie, an African symbol of defence, of authority and leadership. The Protea, at the head of the Black Rod, is South Africa’s national flower, and symbolises national pride. The beadwork reflects South Africa’s diverse people and its rich cultural heritage. The clasping hands in gold symbolises freedom, peace, and cooperation. The Black Rod stands in a drum when the council is in session. The drum is an expression of the African tradition of drums calling people to gather and speak. It is also symbolic of our achievement of democracy through dialogue. START OF PROCEEDINGS The presiding officers bow to the left and right in greeting, and request a moment of silence for prayer or meditation. Once everyone is seated, the presiding officer reads out the notice calling the joint sitting, and calls on the president to deliver his address to the joint sitting. As the joint sitting is called specifically for the president to deliver his Sona, no other business may be considered on this day. The president then delivers the Sona, with debates only taking place the week after the address. The joint rules concerning the order in joint sittings and the rules of debate, contained in Chapter 2A of the Joint Rules of Parliament, apply to the Sona. Joint Rule 12 also further provides that when the Houses sit jointly, the Assembly Rules on discipline remain applicable to assembly members, and the Council Rules on discipline remain applicable to a council member. On the conclusion of the president’s speech, the presiding officer adjourns the sitting. Members are required to wait while the procession leaves the chamber.
