CAPE TOWN - Ten people have been killed in two separate mass shootings in the Eastern Cape, police confirmed on Thursday. Both incidents happened on Wednesday night, and it's not yet clear whether they are linked. In the first incident in Bityi, unknown gunmen killed three three people. In a village in Qunu, seven people were massacred. "The motive for the two incidents is under investigation," said police spokesperson Tembinkosi Kinana. "It is not yet established if there could be any links between the two incidents. Murder cases have been registered. No arrests have been made at this stage." Kinana said the first incident took place at around 8pm, and saw unknown suspects storm a homestead in Thantseka, where they shot dead a 62-year-old woman and her 13-year-old grandson. They then killed the womanâ€™s 44-year-old daughter. The second incident took place in Qunu, just before midnight. Seven victims, four men and three women between the ages 32 and 46, were accosted in a rondavel. All seven were killed. This comes on the back of another shooting on Sunday night, when two gunmen entered a house in the KwaZakhele township in Gqeberha and killed eight people. Three others were wounded. The deceased were gathered for a birthday party. A manhunt for the suspects has been launched, and police are appealing to members of the public who may have information to come forward.
