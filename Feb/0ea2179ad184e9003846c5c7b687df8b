"A solution for all this load shedding. We just need an answer for Eskom," said one Gauteng woman. Another man said: "[He has to] stick to what he says because he doesn't fulfill what he says." Not everyone is buying into the hype of the Sona. "Nah, I don't care," said one man, while another said: "I definitely won't be watching". "The only people who are morally obliged to watch this may be Tottenham Hotspurs."

Gatesville community leader Fowzia Veerasamy said the country’s leaders must take more decisive action, coupled with a will to solve the country’s problems. "I wouldn’t leave my country. I love it too bits, with all the difficulties going on. I was born and raised here. I've been travelling, I know what it is. This is my home, but it’s just our officials from the president down, must step up."
