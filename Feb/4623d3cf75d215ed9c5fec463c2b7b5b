The party said that he played a vital role in the community by raising awareness about gangsterism and other socio-economic issues contributing to violence in townships. It said the allocation of more resources to police stations would address the lack of crime prevention and improve crime intelligence, which would allow for the arrest of prosecution of gangsters.
