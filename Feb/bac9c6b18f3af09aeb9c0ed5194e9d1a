JOHANNESBURG - World leaders have pledged to send aid to Turkiye following an international appeal for help from the country. The most powerful earthquake in nearly a century has struck Turkey and Syria, killing over 1,700 people in their sleep, levelling buildings and causing tremors as far away as Greenland. The 7.8-magnitude night-time tremor was followed by several aftershocks. A huge rumbling crash, screeches of buckling metal and shouts from people running away can be heard in dramatic footage. Social media has been flooded with videos of the destruction, with many showing rescuers working urgently to find any survivors trapped under debris.   Rescue workers and volunteers conduct search and rescue operations in the rubble of a collapsed building, in Diyarbakir on February 6, 2023, after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck the country's south-east.

With the death toll rising rapidly, both countries are warning that aftershocks could continue for days or even weeks.
