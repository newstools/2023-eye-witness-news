JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa will in all likelihood reconfigure his Cabinet after Finance Minister Enoch Gondogwana delivers his budget speech next Wednesday. Eyewitness News understands he told members of the African National Congress (ANC)’s national working committee (NWC) - which met on Monday - there was no need for panic as he would reshuffle his Cabinet in the coming weeks. Pressure has been mounting on the president to make changes to his executive.

South Africans will have to wait a little bit longer before they get a reconfigured government. ANC insiders said Ramaphosa told members of the NWC the matter will be dealt with before the end of February. But he must first attend the African Union’s 36th summit – which is just around the corner. The recent swearing-in of four ANC members to Parliament has added to speculation that Mashatile will assume the deputy president position.

Ramaphosa further fuelled the fire by announcing the introduction of an electricity minister who’ll be based in his office. But this has largely been described by his Cabinet as a project manager who’ll stay on hand to help the country get the electricity crisis under control.
