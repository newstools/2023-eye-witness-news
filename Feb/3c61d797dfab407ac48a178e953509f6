EAST LONDON - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says the justice system is being used to fight politics. The party leader is currently on trial for illegal possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, and three counts of contravening the Firearms Control act. The charges relate to an incident where he allegedly fired a rifle at the EEFâ€™s fifth anniversary celebrations in July 2018.

"But because we hold a different political view, and they want to use the courts and the power they have to persuade us to agree with them. They are not using the political space and argument to persuade us, and that is an attempt to try and intimidate us." The trial is set to continue on Friday.
