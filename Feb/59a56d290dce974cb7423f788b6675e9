JOHANNESBURG - National police commissioner Fannie Masemola said that the police were not aware of any syndicates involving hitmen. His comments came after the recent crime statistics showed a sharp rise in incidents of gun violence in the country. Minister of Police Bheki Cele released the crime figures last week for the period between October and December 2022. It showed that over 7,000  people were murdered over this period, with at least 3,000 involving a firearm.

Masemola said that in most cases, police were unable to prevent them from happening. “In certain cases, we do have intelligence and these people are arrested in time, but unfortunately in other instances, we arrest them after. You have to take note that it’s crime that is planned behind closed doors."
