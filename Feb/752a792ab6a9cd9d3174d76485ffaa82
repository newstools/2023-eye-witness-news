CAPE TOWN - Humanitarian aid organisation Gift of the Givers said its rescue and medical teams are expected to leave for disaster-stricken TÃ¼rkiye on Tuesday night. There's been widespread devastation following Monday's 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck the eastern European country and neighbouring Syria. The death toll from the earthquake has now surpassed the 5,000 mark and it's expected to rise. Rescue and disaster teams continue to brave freezing temperatures - searching for survivors buried by the string of subsequent aftershocks. Gift of the Givers founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said they've opened their own hospital on the border between TÃ¼rkiye and Syria to provide help to those in need. "The numbers are going to be very high we have opened up our stand by the hospital  on the border with TÃ¼rkiye and Syria, moving patients and  putting additional medical teams on-site."

The foundation added that its volunteers landed in Istanbul but the affected areas cannot be accessed. It said it will provide food and shelter to those affected, once the roads leading to those areas are open. The foundation's Azhar Vadi said millions of people will be sleeping without shelter on Tuesday tonight.
