"These crimes are on the increase in South Africa, and while we need to effectively address kidnapping and extortion, we also need to equip the officers who respond and investigate," Smith said. "The knowledge gained and relationships built are invaluable in combatting the syndicates involved in these crimes in Cape Town. "By working together, we are able to enhance our capabilities, strengthen our response, and possibly prevent some of these crimes."
