JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg Water says residents who have suffered week-long water cuts should have consistent supply by Friday. Parts of Gauteng have been crippled with water shortages linked to power cuts as pumps have not been working. At least 18 reservoirs in the city were struggling to pump water to residents, with four towers at critically low water levels.
