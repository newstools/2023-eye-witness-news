CAPE TOWN - On Thursday, hours before the State of the Nation Address (Sona), Parliament explained the reason for the almost R10 million budget allocation for proceedings and subsequent debates. Updating the media on final logistics, Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said the budget for the Sona - which stands at R8 million - was a hard call as the government did not have a choice. “Because the things that we had to pay for previously we did not have to pay. Things like broadcasting facilities, your live transmissions to the various television stations in the country in order to reach and involve South Africans in the business of Parliament, the conferencing facilities, are things we did not have to pay for.” READ: What you need to know about the State of the Nation Address Parliament said it was expecting a full house at the Sona, with hundreds of guests ranging from former President Thabo Mbeki to former Speaker Baleka Mbete, and international netball world cup players.
