 CAPE TOWN - Gift of the Givers volunteers arrived back in South Africa on Saturday, following a 10-day relief effort mission in Turkiye. The group landed at the Cape Town International Airport, to visibly emotional friends and family. Over 43,000 people died after an earthquake that measured 7.8 on the magnitude scale hit Turkiye and Syria earlier this month. This was followed by another quake, measuring 7.6, less than 12 hours later, with multiple aftershocks since. Gift of the Givers joined relief teams from around the globe, who also heeded the call to help the tragedy-stricken region.  The volunteers told stories of sadness and loss, but also praised the people of Turkiye for their hospitality, despite what they were experiencing. A member of the Gift of the Givers team that was deployed to Turkiye described the experience as “bittersweet” as nine members of the team arrived at the airport to the loving embraces of their friends and family. Urban search and rescue technical rescuer David Bruiners said he often works away from home, however, this time hit differently for him. “An incident of this magnitude is overbearing and overwhelming for us. But just the fact that we could make a small difference in the area we were deployed to is bittersweet for us.” It’s left the region in ruins and the scale of the human tragedy is staggering, with the death toll climbing, and thousands more still missing, almost two weeks on.
