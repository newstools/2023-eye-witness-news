CAPE TOWN - Acting Public Protector Kholeka Gcaleka said the impeachment inquiry of the suspended incumbent, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, has caused significant reputational damage to the Office of the Public Protector. As the office teeters on the brink of bankruptcy, Gcaleka told MPs that Mkhwebane's legal costs to defend herself at the Section 194 inquiry were draining the institution's budget. She estimated that Mkhwebane's legal fees would exceed R15 million, with invoices up to September having already reached R9 million.

The process has gone very far, it should be allowed to conclude.” The Department of Justice said it would help to foot Mkhwebane’s inquiry bills, at least until the end of the financial year.
