JOHANNESBURG - Former Eskom contracts manager France Hlakudi’s tax fraud trial stalled again. Hlakudi is facing 44 counts of fraud valued at a total of R30 million relating both to his own personal tax affairs as well as to the tax affairs of a number of his companies. He’s accused of doctoring some of his tax returns and failing to submit others with some of the alleged crimes dating as far back as 2005. The trial got underway in 2022 but was then put on ice after Hlakudi’s attorneys withdrew and he indicated he wanted to apply for legal aid. READ: Court issues arrest warrant for ex-Eskom exec France Hlakudi Hlakudi made a brief appearance in the dock of the Pretoria Regional Court on Monday with a new legal aid attorney in tow. But proceedings did not go ahead as planned. The court heard Hlakudi’s new lawyer had not yet received written instructions from his client and so the case was postponed until this coming Thursday. This is to allow Hlakudi to then consult again with his legal representative from legal aid and then provide him with the written instructions in order to then proceed with this matter," said the Investigating Directorate’s Sindisiwe Seboka.
