"Today, since 2021 to date the local government coalition governments have risen from 27 to 87 led by more than six parties to date. That tells us that there is a crisis that we are going towards." He noted that Salga developed a framework for coalition governments to help manage the unstable situation of local government. Opposition parties also called for greater intervention to help turn around struggling municipalities. Cllr Stofile says that declaring the state of disaster to some municipalities was the right decision. He says that local government would like to take part in the national energy crisis committee to provide local perspective. pic.twitter.com/hspgco8VMC
