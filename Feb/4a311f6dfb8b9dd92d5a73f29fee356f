CAPE TOWN - The discovery of an elderly woman under a heap of rubble and debris was described as a miracle as search and rescue teams continued to look for victims and survivors in disaster-stricken Türkiye and Syria. The 80-year-old was rescued in Hatay on Monday, exactly a week after two powerful earthquakes hit the region. Gift of the givers said that a K9 sniffer dog, Donna, picked up the woman's scent and physically started digging.
