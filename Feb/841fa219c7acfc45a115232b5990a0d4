JOHANNESBURG - The water and sanitation department said on Sunday that five sluice gates at the Vaal Dam were closed over the weekend. The department said it was able to close the flood gates due to subsiding water levels.

The department said the water level at the Bloemhof Dam had also declined and was sitting at 107%. "At the Douglas Weir Dam, at the confluence of Vaal and Orange rivers, the storage capacity of the dam is currently sitting at 170%," said department spokesperson Wisane Mavasa. "The department continues to closely monitor the water flow in the affected rivers and dams, and urges communities to remain alert and avoid low lying bridges, overflowing rivers and streams." Mavasa said more sluice gate would be closed if the water levels  continued to decrease.
