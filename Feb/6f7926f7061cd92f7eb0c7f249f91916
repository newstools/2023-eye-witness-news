CAPE TOWN - Transport union Untu has applied to the Labour Court to hold the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) in contempt of court after the state-owned company failed to pay backdated salary increases to some of its workers for the 2021/22 financial year. This comes after Prasa missed last week’s initial deadline to calculate and start payment of the outstanding salaries. The Labour Court recently ordered the state-owned entity to honour part of a three-year wage agreement that would see workers affiliated with Untu paid a 5% wage for each financial year between 2020 and 2023. While Prasa has approached the transport union's leaders, calling for a meeting to talk payment plans, the embattled company has failed to abide by parts of the court order. Untu general secretary Cobus van Vuuren said the union also wants a writ of execution to have Prasa’s bank accounts attached. “If the contempt of court is issued then, of course, there will be an arrest.”
