'JOHANNESBURG - Former Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter said it was practically impossible for the utility to exempt schools, hospitals and small businesses from load shedding. This was revealed in a court affidavit deposed by De Ruyter before he left office last week. The affidavit was a response to a court application by the UDM (United Democratic Movement) and 18 others against Eskom. They're seeking to hold the power utility and government accountable for load shedding.
