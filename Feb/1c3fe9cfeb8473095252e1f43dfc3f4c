JOHANNESBURG - A Tembisa police officer accused of murdering his girlfriend who was a nurse failed to present his plea proposal before the Johannesburg High Court on Friday. Lucky Mudau is accused of premeditated murder for allegedly shooting Lebo Monene while she was on duty at the Tembisa Hospital almost a year ago, and then turning the gun on himself. The incident has left him paralysed, and he now uses a wheelchair. He made a brief court appearance on Friday, accompanied by at least six family members.
