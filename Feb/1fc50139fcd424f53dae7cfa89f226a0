The premier is expected to reveal to the province how the government is planning to deal with various issues impacting KwaZulu-Natal, especially the lack of service delivery. Dube-Ncube took over as premier following the resignation of then-premier Sihle Zikalala in August last year, around the time KZN was emerging from the devastating floods which destroyed property and claimed hundreds of lives. The damage caused by the floods also took a toll on the province's economy as departments had to reprioritise their budgets in the rebuilding efforts, with the damage cost estimated to be R25 billion On Friday, the premier will have to account to KZN residents on what has been done so far. Some residents also expect her to outline how crime will be tackled, following various deadly shooting incidents, including mass shootings. The lack of service delivery also continues to be a concern, with communities like Dukuduku in northern KZN not having access to clean running water for almost a decade.
