CAPE TOWN - Acting Public Protector Kholeka Gcaleka says the impeachment inquiry of suspended incumbent Busisiwe Mkhwebane is draining the finances of that office. She told Parliament she estimated the cost of Mkhwebane’s legal representation at the section 194 inquiry would reach between R12 million and R15 million. Gcaleka was briefing the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services on challenges faced by the public protector’s office, among them the solvency of the institution. She said without additional assistance from the Department of Justice and Correctional Services, the public protector’s office (PPSA) would fail to be a going concern.

I think the whole situation, none of us had foreseen it would get to this extent and it would become such an expense.” Last week, Mkhwebane’s advocate Dali Mpofu told the section 194 inquiry the legal team has not been paid for months. “We have an outstanding invoice which we are vigorously interrogating because of the aspects that have come out in the public, and some which we have experienced," Gcaleka said. Members of Parliament have requested Gcaleka to provide details of the cost of accommodation, travel and security for Mkhwebane’s team, which she promised to provide by the end of the day.
