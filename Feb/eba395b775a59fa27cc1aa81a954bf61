JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg City Power said that it would not hesitate to call on law enforcement to protect its workers who were dealing with outages in the Westbury, Claremont, and surrounding areas, if need be. The utility's CEO, Tshifularo Mashava, joined repair teams at the weekend, supported by the local councillors, to ensure the outages were addressed. City Power's Isaac Mangena said that they managed to make major progress in several areas. "The CEO has actually expressed appreciation for the understanding by the residents and commended the support that our teams have really received from the councillors and the community to ensure that there are minimal interruptions to service delivery in the areas." However, there were concerns about the safety of employees following reports of violence in some areas, but the teams continued their work.
