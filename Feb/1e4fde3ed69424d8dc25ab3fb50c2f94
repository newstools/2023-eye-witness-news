CAPE TOWN - Social movements, labour and grassroots organisations protesting outside Parliament say they are tired of empty promises from government. They want Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana to table a budget that will benefit the poor and working class people. READ: Godongwana facing tough decisions on SOE bailouts, says economist Social movements from across Cape Town under the banner Cry for the Xcluded Forum are calling on Godongwana to clearly state how government plans to tackle the country's energy crisis, high unemployment, service delivery, and gender-based violence, among other things. The forum's Madoda Cuphe said people are tired of the people's deteriorating living conditions in their areas. "Our communities are drowned by rubbish everywhere, there's potholes everywhere, we're living with raw sewage in the streets. Something that you flush in the toilet comes out in front of your door." Cuphe said they could not sit idle and watch their communities collapse.
