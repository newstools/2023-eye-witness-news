CAPE TOWN - The Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Gwede Mantashe, highlighted the severe impact of load shedding saying it cost the country’s economy R1 billion per day. Mantashe addressed delegates at the opening of the 2023 Investing in African Mining Indaba in Cape Town on Monday. Mantashe reflected on the severe electricity supply disruptions and their impact on the country, particularly in 2022. In November, mining production contracted by 9%, marking a 10th consecutive month of contraction in volumes produced.
