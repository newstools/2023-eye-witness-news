JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighter’s (EFF) Nthabiseng Tshivhenga is now the interim speaker of the City of Ekurhuleni in the absence of Raymond Dhlamini. Former speaker Dhlamini, who was due to face a motion of no confidence, on Thursday suspended proceedings and walked out of the council with his party, the Democratic Alliance (DA).

Dhlamini was accused of presiding over a DA-led municipality that was failing to deliver decent services to residents. As the dust settled well into night in Ekurhuleni, Tshivhenga and the African National Congress’ (ANC) Jongizizwe Dlabathi have now been tasked with overseeing the city’s council at least for the next seven days. Dlabathi was elected as acting council whip on Thursday following the resignation of the DA’s Khetha Shandu. A long-drawn-out battle saw the majority parties in the city, the ANC, the EFF, along with their smaller counterpart the Patriotic Alliance (PA), forging ahead with the meeting, even after Dhlamini attempted to, once again, stop proceedings.

The house also seemed set to do away with rules that stopped a no-confidence motion against the mayor from immediately going ahead. Meanwhile, ActionSA called on the Gauteng government to intervene in the running battles, warning of their impact on service delivery.
