CAPE TOWN - The African Transformation Movement (ATM) was expected back in the high court in Cape Town on Tuesday. It is asking the court to set aside a decision by National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula not to grant a secret ballot on an impeachment report against President Cyril Ramaphosa in December last year. READ: ATM challenges secret ballot decision on Section 89 report vote The ATM alleged African National Congress (ANC) members of Parliament  were under threat of being disciplined if they did not reject the section 89 report. On Monday, Advocate Anton Katz, on behalf of the ATM, told the court that it appeared the Speaker was in the habit of rejecting requests for a secret ballot, and ignoring the prevailing toxic political environment. On Monday, the EFF joined the fray, arguing the Speaker was whimsical in her decision-making. EFF legal counsel, advocate Mfesane Ka-Siboto argued Mapisa-Nqakula failed to look at the facts at her disposal. But advocate Steven Budlender, representing the Speaker, rejected their arguments, saying his client had exercised her discretionary power. Budlender said her decision was rational and independent and could not be measured by empirical facts.
