CAPE TOWN - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) vowed to continue protesting against President Cyril Ramaphosa until he steps down from office. EFF leader Julius Malema said the party is not shaken by their forceful removal from the Cape Town City Hall, for trying to prevent Ramaphosa from delivering his State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday night.

Malema said he has nothing personal against Ramaphosa, and will never physically harm him. But it’s a matter of principle that he’s held to account for his actions.  "What we are doing to Ramaphosa is what we did to Zuma about Nkandla, about 'pay back the money'. It can’t be [different] rules for Zuma and different rules for Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa’s Phala Phala will never die."

"Because if they think that it’s going to die and be swept under the carpet, then what they saw yesterday is going to be a picnic." Malema said the party does not want Parliament to be criticised again for not holding the executive accountable.
