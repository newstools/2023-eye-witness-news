CAPE TOWN - While volunteers from Gift of the Givers returned to South Africa, the organisation said that it would continue to aid Türkiye and Syria from the country. Volunteers arrived back on home soil on Sunday, after spending 10 days in Türkiye assisting with search and rescue operations in the wake of the earthquake that hit the country on the border with Syria. Gift of the Givers was one of several organisations that responded, after both countries were hit by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake earlier in February.

It was an emotional and physically taxing 10 days for the organisation’s teams who were deployed to Türkiye. Rescue workers were digging through rubble to find some form of life or to offer closure to family members who lost loved ones.

Medical equipment and supplies will also be going into Syria.” Sooliman said they were also arranging shipments of rice, wheelchairs, and blankets to Syria.
