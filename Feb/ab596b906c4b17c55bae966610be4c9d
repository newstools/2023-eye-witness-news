JOHANNESBURG - The family of slain Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) student Ntokozo Xaba said it appreciates the support it's been given by the institution following the incident. The third-year Integrated Communication student was remembered at Thursday's memorial service at the university's Soshanguve campus. The 21-year-old was found dead at her off-campus residence in Pretoria Gardens last week, after her friends could not reach her over the phone. Her ex-boyfriend, Ngcebo Thusi, has since been charged with the murder.
