JOHANNESBURG - Newly elected Joburg Mayor Thapelo Amad  on Thursday announced his mayoral committee. The last committee left office after the Democratic Alliance's Mpho Phalatse  was ousted through a no-confidence vote last week.

Amad is expected to announce two more members  of the mayoral committee (MMCs) on Friday. Former Joburg mayor and ANC caucus leader Dada Morero - whose time in office was short-lived – has been appointed as finance MMC. His party members - Loyiso Masuku, Jack Sekwaila, Eunice Mgina, Nomoya Mnisi and Anthea Leitch have also made it to the mayoral committee. Meanwhile - the EFF's caucus leader - Sepetlele Raseruthe - has been appointed MMC for Public Safety. The African Transformation Movement’s Lubabalo Magwentshu who was at the forefront of Phalatse’s ousting is the new MMC for community development.
