But Eskom said it had contingency plans in place should it face more challenges. "I can give the country the assurance that we’re doing everything in our power to ensure that we do not end up in a situation where we go beyond that [stage 6]. But, of course, the system has an inherent lack of reliability and that gives us the need to plan for these unforeseen events," said the utility's CEO Andre de Ruyter.
