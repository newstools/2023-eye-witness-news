JOHANNESBURG - Department of Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said she had excused herself from appearing before the Portfolio Committee on Tourism's meeting. The committee heard acting South African Tourism CEO Themba Khumalo explain and defend a controversial sponsorship deal with English football club Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday. In the meeting, committee chairperson Thandi Mahambehlala took a dim view of Sisulu's absence. Mahambehlala said Sisulu needed  to explain why, three months since their appointment, the names of the SA Tourism board had not yet been gazetted.

Sisulu's spokesperson Steve Motale said Sisulu took "exception" to her written apology not being read out to the committee. "Minister Sisulu wishes to re-emphasise yet again that she respects the Portfolio Committee in its role as an extension of Parliament to exercise oversight. She has always supported the mandate and work of the committee and will continue to do so," Motale said. He added that Sisulu did join the portfolio committee meeting after the Joint Cabinet Committees meeting.
