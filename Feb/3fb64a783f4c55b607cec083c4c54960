JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA)-led multiparty coalition in Tshwane said it will be submitting a motion of no confidence in Council Speaker, Dr Murunwa Makwarela. Makwarela is a councillor for the Congress of the People (Cope), which is a part of the coalition. Two days after Makwarela said there was a conspiracy by coalition partners to remove him from his position, the multiparty coalition has released a statement saying they intend on filing a motion of no confidence in him.

It also said Makwerela has refused to convene a special council sitting to elect a new mayor. This week, the coalition unveiled former da member of parliament  Cilliers Brink as its preferred mayoral candidate.
