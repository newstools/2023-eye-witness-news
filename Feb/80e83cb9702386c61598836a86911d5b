JOHANNESBURG - With one year today since the war in Ukraine began, South Africa's military drills with Russian and Chinese forces have once again been called into question. On Thursday, the United Nations called for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, and the motion was backed by 141 nations. Thirty-two other countries abstained, including South Africa and China, and seven, including Russia, voted against the motion.
