JOHANNESBURG - Ousted Ekurhuleni Speaker Raymond Dhlamini says the Democratic Alliance(DA)-led multiparty coalition needs more time in government to turn the city around. READ: Ekurhuleni council chief whip Khetha Shandu resigns The coalition has effectively been removed from the government and Mayor Tania Campbell is the only DA member left occupying an executive seat. Unlike the last time when Dhlamini approached the court to have his removal reversed, he said he has no qualms about the process this time.

You need more time so the multiparty is strong because we understand the vision, it’s not something that you can just sleep and wake up and everything is fine. But we will continue to work together."
