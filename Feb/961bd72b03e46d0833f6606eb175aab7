EAST LONDON - The case against Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema and his bodyguard, Adriaan Snyman, continued in the East London Magistrates Court on Wednesday. Malema faces charges of illegal possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, and three counts of contravening the Firearms Control Act, while Snyman faces one count of contravening the act.

On Tuesday, the court ruled in favour of the State using a video clip that allegedly shows Malema firing a rifle in the trial. Thus far, the clip, which went viral, was the centre of arguments in the matter this week. Malema’s defence team’s request for a trial within a trial over the admissibility of the clip was rejected. A witness, meanwhile, who was working as part of an audiovisual crew on the day, told the court on Tuesday that the clip was not captured by their cameras. However, the State said it believed it had a solid case against the two accused.
