CAPE TOWN - Stellenbosch Football Club said over the weekend that promising young defender Oshwin Andries's presence "would be sorely missed, both on and off the pitch". The club released a statement after the 19-year-old died in Cape Town on Saturday night. He was allegedly readmitted to a hospital on the day of his death after recently suffering from a stab wound. The club called the "promising young defender" a "gifted young footballer" who graduated from the club's academy to make his professional debut at the age of 18. Andries became the clubâ€™s youngest ever goal scorer in the DStv Premiership and captained South Africa at the recent Under-20 Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (COSAFA) qualifiers. The South African Football Association (SAFA) also extended its condolences to the player's friends and family, calling Andries a rising star. Meanwhile, police said circumstances around the stabbing incident were still under investigation.
