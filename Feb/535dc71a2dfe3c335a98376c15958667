JOHANNESBURG - The country's biggest business grouping, Business Unity South Africa (Busa), has lobbied President Cyril Ramaphosa to speed up the implementation of economic reforms. Ramaphosa came into power in 2018 on a ticket for reform, including plans to reduce trade barriers, cut red tape for entrepreneurs, as well as fast-track infrastructure development. But he faced renewed criticism over the slow implementation of these reforms.

"He's got to rebuild trust amongst people. He's got to send a clear message that he will work with business."

"If there is money available, sure, but we can't do everything. "We've got to make some choices, and we believe the choices need to be such that money eventually needs to be spent on implementing stuff that will sustainably bring an environment where families can do their business."
