JOHANNESBURG - The Commissioner of the National Lotteries Commission (NLC), Jodi Scholtz, said that it would be difficult to give jobs back to the whistleblowers that reported on corruption, and refused to be part of theft at the organisation. Former employees at the commission penned a letter to the newly elected commissioner, who has been trying to reverse years of large-scale looting of lottery money.

So, I’m hoping in the next six weeks, or so, that we’ll be able to finalise the procurement processes around those and then start rolling that out.”
