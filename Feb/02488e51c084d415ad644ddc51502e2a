The pair are included in the new administration led by Joburg Mayor Thapelo Amad who unveiled various MMCs on Thursday. Kunene said his criminal record would not come in the way of his role as an executive member, and assured he could be trusted with city's public coffers. Kunene served more than five years behind bars in 1997 after being convicted of running a Ponzi scheme. While Kunene said service delivery was the top priority for the city's new mayoral committee, he was yet to set out his office's agenda.
