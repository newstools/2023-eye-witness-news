Ramaphosa said mining revenues help the government to provide services to the citizens of the country. “The mining sector is an important contributor to the growth of our economy but also to job creation, and retention, accounting for close on to half a million direct jobs and close on to a million indirect jobs," he explained. Ramaphosa emphasised that mining revenues in 2022 reached a record high of R1.18 trillion. “Boosting our GDP, our exports, and revenues, despite this achievement we are far from realising the full potential of our mining industry. We are determined however to remove all impediments, everything that stands in the way and create an environment that will drive sustained growth in mining."
