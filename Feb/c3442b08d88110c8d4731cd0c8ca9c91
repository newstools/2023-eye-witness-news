JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) provincial executive committee (PEC) has taken a decision to recall Premier Sisi Ntombela and Mangaung mayor Mxolisi Siyonzana. Eyewitness News understands that this will be communicated soon. The Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) is holding a lekgotla where the assessment of governance at provincial and local levels forms part of the agenda. Last month, Ntombela failed in her bid to nab the position of ANC chairperson after losing to Mxolisi Dukwana at the provincial elective conference. In August, the ANC in Mangaung resolved that Siyonzana should be recalled as mayor. The PEC has now affirmed that decision. The municipality has been plagued by serious allegations of maladministration, mismanagement of funds, corruption, and service delivery.
