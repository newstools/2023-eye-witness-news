JOHANNESBURG - Another wild animal has escaped â€“ this time in the North West. Conservationists and farmers are looking for a lion. Reports say that the lion escaped from her container while being transported with a male lion from the town of Stella to another farm area on Wednesday morning. Animal control specialist, Nanti Strydom: "Community members are warned that a lioness escaped. The owner only realised that she escaped when he reached his destination at Tlakgameng. If anybody has any information or has seen anything, please contact nature conservation of your local police station if you see the lioness." The provincial environment and conservation department said the owner of the lionness discovered her container was empty when arriving at the game farm. A helicopter has since been deployed to look for the lion. "The rescue mission that involved a chopper has since started and the mission will also continue today. Communities around Setlagole, Stella, and Tlakgameng are alerted not attempt to capture the lion," the department's Jerry Matebetse said. A number of big wild cats have escaped from captivity in the past few months, including a tiger, which was shot dead in Walkerville.
