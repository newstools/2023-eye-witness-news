"I just want to know from you professionals, where does it start?", a concerned parent asked during an interaction with health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo over their concerns regarding the measles outbreak. Mbombo on Wednesday launched the vaccination drive at the Kleinvlei Community Health Centre. "It is worrisome because measles is preventable and we do know once a child contracts measles, especially if he's a vulnerable child, for example, to other illnesses, pneumonia and everything, it is quite actually fatal, so that's why we urge everyone to come." The department said that with more children under the age of 15 being vaccinated against measles, the risks of both short- and long-term potential complications were reduced.
