CAPE TOWN - National Assembly (NA) speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula is set to face her first motion of no confidence on 7 March. The date was set on Thursday by the National Assembly’s (NA) Programme Committee, after the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) lodged a complaint against her following the State of the Nation Address (Sona) on 9 February. They said she failed to act fairly and impartially when she allowed security services into the Cape Town City Hill to remove their members of Parliament (MPs) during a protest against President Cyril Ramaphosa. Not since former speaker Baleka Mbete first faced a motion of no confidence from five opposition parties in 2014 has a political party called for the removal of the NA speaker.

You will get that information through the chief whip’s forum. “ African National Congress (ANC) chief whip Pemmy Majodina reserved her comment on whether she was in support of a secret ballot, saying she did not want to compromise Mapisa-Nqakula.
