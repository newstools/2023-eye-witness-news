JOHANNESBURG - The family of slain nurse Lebo Monene expressed concern and fear over a potential plea bargain from the man accused of murdering her. Lucky Mudau is accused of premeditated murder for allegedly shooting Monene, who was his girlfriend, in the parking lot of Tembisa Hospital almost a year ago. The policeman then turned the gun on himself. The incident left Mudau paralysed, and he now uses a wheelchair. READ: Family of nurse Lebo Monene believe police action could have prevented her death On Friday, the Johannesburg High Court was meant to hear the details of a plea bargain between Mudau's lawyers and the state. However, that could not happen because his lawyers had not submitted a plea proposal. READ: Case of cop accused of Tembisa hospital nurse's murder postponed to next week Monene's family, who are already disappointed about the delays in the case, said they were unsure about what the plea bargain would mean. “If he says 10 years, if you don’t take 10 years, then nothing happens…We were hoping for a minimum of life sentence, but I don’t know, we will see. But of the look of things, I don’t see that happening,” said her brother, Daniel Thobakgale. The matter was postponed to allow for Mudau's lawyers to make a plea proposal. If the state does not accept the proposal made, Mudau will have to stand trial.
