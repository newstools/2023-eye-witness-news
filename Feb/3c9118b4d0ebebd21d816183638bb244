"As you understand, at the beginning of the year there are students who are unable to pay their fees, not because they don't want [to], it's because they can't afford [it]. What us as the SRC are standing for is a university must lift up their fees, now they are trying to get council to meet with us to negotiate on that. "That is our demand, all students must be allowed to register and be given residence so that academic studies can go forward," Khorommbi said. Similar concerns were raised by students at UWC on Monday.
