IMPACT OF LOAD SHEDDING ON HIGH FOOD INFLATION Meanwhile, there are concerns that load shedding will continue to have a knock-on effect on high food inflation. Economist Azar Jammine said while the drop in consumer inflation is in line with predictions, the sky rocketing food prices are still shocking. “Many food producers are reluctant to refrigerate and where they have refrigerated and load shedding has occurred, the food has gotten rotten. So generally, what they are doing is they are supplying less to the market, producing less.”
