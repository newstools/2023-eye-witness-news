JOHANNESBURG - With calls for a state of disaster to be declared with increased funding, there are concerns that this may not be the only solution to Eskom’s problems. The utility said funds were needed to buy gas and diesel to drive Eskom’s back-up systems, but the Kusile and Medupi power stations are still not operating properly. These two power stations were an earlier solution to the country's power problems.

Four out of 6 [units] are not working, 1 out of 6 Medupi units are not working," Eskom reduced loadshedding to stage 4 on Friday morning, with stage 3 kicking in on Saturday from 5am until Sunday morning.
