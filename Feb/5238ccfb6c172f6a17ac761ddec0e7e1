JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa said the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the disparities in access to quality health services and products. He is together with some ministers in his Cabinet attending the 36th Ordinary Session of the African Union (AU) Assembly of Heads of State and Government in Ethiopia this weekend. Delivering an address at a meeting of heads of state and government at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Saturday, Ramaphosa said the onus falls on member states of the African Union (AU) to advance the agenda of equitable healthcare for all. As health emergencies increase across Africa, he said the continent‚Äôs full pandemic preparedness and its progress in achieving universal health coverage are being impeded. Ramaphosa added that the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the continent needs a more robust health system to deal with future potential health emergencies. "We reaffirm our support for the call to action contained in the communique of the event on Africa‚Äôs new public health order and rejuvenating the global health security agenda, that took place on the margins of the 77th session of the United Nations general assembly," Ramaphosa said. In the call to action, heads of state and government call for the full implementation of Africa‚Äôs New Public Health Order, which includes: His Excellency President @CyrilRamaphosa has arrived in Addis Ababa for the 36th Ordinary Session of the @_AfricanUnion Assembly of Heads of State and Government to be held on 18/19 February 2023 under the theme: ‚ÄúAcceleration of #AfCFTA Implementation‚Äù. #TheAfricaWeWant üåç pic.twitter.com/MjNfBy9uDx
