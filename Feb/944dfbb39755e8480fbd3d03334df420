JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa has released an opposing affidavit in the case being brought by the United Democratic Movement (UDM) and 18 others, clarifying government's position on the provision of electricity under the Constitution. The group wants the high court to declare the African National Congress (ANC)-led government's response to load shedding as unconstitutional and breaching a number of fundamental human rights. The case is set to be heard on 20 March in the high court.
