Your love for the sport is enough to teach you and keep you dedicated,” said Moganedi. The UJ Sport for Students with Disabilities Club athlete was selected in 2022 to represent South Africa at the IWBF Afro World Championships held in Ethiopia. In August, Moganedi captained the SA 3 on 3 Wheelchair Basketball team at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, finishing in 5th place. “My family, coaches and managers have been amazing to me and also not forgetting the older players from the men’s team whom I constantly learn from. Not forgetting our sponsor Sasol, who has been with WBSA [Wheelchair Basketball South Africa} since day one, they have backed us and funded us and because of them myself and my teammates live the impossible,” beamed Moganedi.

I hope that para-sport will be seen.” 𝐖𝐇𝐄𝐄𝐋𝐂𝐇𝐀𝐈𝐑 𝐁𝐀𝐒𝐊𝐄𝐓𝐁𝐀𝐋𝐋Congratulations to the UJ student-athlete, Michelle Moganedi and the South African wheelchair basketball team at large for winning the African 2022 U/25 world championship qualifier#UJAllTheWay #Africau20wcqt #LiveTheImpossible pic.twitter.com/GWbmsrOsri
