The Blue Bulls Rugby Union said it condemned all forms of GBV, and expressed concern that the country continued to bleed because children and women were not safe. TUT said it would provide all the necessary support to the family of the third-year integrated communications student. On Sunday night, friends and fellow TUT students will host a candlelit vigil at the Ekhaya residence where Xaba had lived for three years, and where her life was cut short.
