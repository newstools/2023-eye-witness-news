Hill-Lewis says the event was a special moment for the country, and an opportunity to bring people together. "Many people, millions, literally millions of people who have never watched a women's cricket match before I think will now be tuning in regularly to see this incredible team play, that's a great thing for the sport. Secondly, I think it energised our country, brought the country together, and gave it a real sense of excitement and hope."

"Obviously the goal of the World Cup is to win the World Cup. I think if you look at the background of women's sports and women's cricket in South Africa, I think it was always going to be tough to get to that final, to get through India, England and Australia. I'm so immensely proud of the girls and what we have achieved. I think we inspired the whole nation, I think we have done ourselves proud as well." 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦#T20WorldCup #AlwaysRising pic.twitter.com/UnklNoqmda
