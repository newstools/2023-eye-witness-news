CAPE TOWN - National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has referred Thursday night's fracas involving the Economic Freedom Fighters to Parliament's joint rules committee for investigation. Parliament's joint rules committee will have to consider whether the speaker was correct in her decision to evict EFF MPs from the state of the nation address in terms of a rule that deals with disregard for the chair, and the gross disorderliness of members.
