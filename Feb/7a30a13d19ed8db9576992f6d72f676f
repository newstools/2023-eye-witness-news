JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng has been warned to brace for heavy downpours as the South African Weather Service (SAWS) on Wednesday issued an orange level 5 warning. The province, especially over the southern region, could see a "significant impact" as a result of intense rainfall of between 50mm and 80mm. Roads and settlements could become flooded and traffic flow is at risk of being disrupted, owing to major roads being flooded or closed. Fast-flowing streams could also pose a danger, SAWS warned. ❗️Weather warning❗️ Orange level 5 warning for disruptive rain for today: 15/02/2023. pic.twitter.com/v285D3d0Wu  The same warning applies to the Eastern Cape.

Widespread showers and thunderstorms are forecast for the rest of the week for a large part of the country. KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Mpumalanga were issued an orange level 9 impact-based warnings earlier this week. Mpumalanga and Limpopo have since had their weather notices downscaled to a yellow level 2 warning on Wednesday.
