CAPE TOWN - There are claims minibus taxi operators are threatening and harassing scholar transport operators in at least two Cape Town communities - Khayelitsha and Mfuleni. Education MEC David Maynier believes it's an attempt to muscle in on transport contracts and extort money from the department. READ: CT commuters urged to find alternative transport during taxi strike Maynier on Monday visited Academia Primary School in Khayelitsha where more than 50% of pupils were prevented from going to school due to an illegal blockade. Maynier said minibus taxi associations were falsly claiming they were promised contracts by his department. He said the groups appear to be demanding contracts - without following tender processes: "They have now allegedly issued a threat to offload learners from any transport not operated by minibus taxi association members, including parents driving their children to school because their usual transport is not operating." Maynier's stressed the department will not meet with any minibus taxi association until the blockade is terminated and teaching and learning resume without disruption. The MEC scheduled a meeting with police to find solutions to the attempted extortion and intimidation. We will not tolerate extortion attempts by minibus taxi associations, which kept up to 2 400 learners home from school last week.Read more here: https://t.co/MIoHyRawOB pic.twitter.com/yeuFUb1zyD
