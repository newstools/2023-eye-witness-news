JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi said that the province was open to buying any form of energy to curb load shedding. Lesufi was addressing the Gauteng Energy Expo in Johannesburg on Thursday where industry experts gathered to contribute to the province's energy security strategy. Lesufi said that the expo was for energy producers to pitch their ideas and products to Gauteng. He said that it was important that Gauteng, as the economic hub of South Africa, was protected from the devastating economic impacts of load shedding. “Those institutions that are at the forefront of rendering services to our people. We need to assist them, we need these institutions to have the energy that can be provided. Where we are as a local government, we have reached a stage where any form of energy must be brought to the table, any form of energy must be presented to us."

The premier said it was possible for the load shedding crisis to unlock new investment opportunities in the province. He added that the provincial government was open to procuring electricity from independent power producers provided there will be a return on investment. “We are of the strong view that the new gold is this challenge. This is the gold that we can polish, that we can train young people. This is the gold that we can employ thousands and thousands of unemployed people to go and install energy in our communities.” Business representatives at the expo pitched proposals to the provincial government, ranging from green hydrogen and waste to energy ideas.
