CAPE TOWN - The country's new deputy president, Paul Mashatile, will have his first Parliamentary engagement as the leader of government business on 23 March, where he's due to answer questions in the National Assembly (NA). This week's Cabinet reshuffle saw several portfolio committee meetings in Parliament be postponed to give new ministers some time to familiarise themselves with their new postings. Ministers also came under fire from NA speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula this week for not being ready to answer members of Parliament’s (MPs) questions timeously. The president and his deputy are required to answer a set of six prepared questions at least once a quarter. The date for the deputy president’s question time was already set prior to David Mabuza’s official resignation and Mashatile taking over the reins. Parliament’s programming whip Mina Lesoma said Mashatile did not want his question-and-answer session to be postponed to allow himself more time to settle into the job. “As new as he is, he’s comfortable that we don’t change the date. The date was pre-agreed when we were looking at the framework of the National Assembly programme for 2023.” The national council of provinces was also due to have a question-and-answer session for the deputy president next week. But it said it would be adjusting its programme to move the original date to April.
