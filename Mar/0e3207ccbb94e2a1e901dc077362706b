CAPE TOWN - President Cyril Ramaphosa will return to Parliament on Thursday to respond to questions in the National Assembly (NA) in his first question and answer session of 2023. Members of Parliament (MPs) are expected to grill Ramaphosa on several questions ranging from the fight against crime to the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan.

However, unlike the last interaction at Cape Town City Hall, Thursday’s sitting is being held as a hybrid event, with some MPs attending physically inside the Good Hope Chamber at Parliament. Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema is due to ask Ramaphosa whether he remains confident that the Minister of Police Bheki Cele and National Police Commissioner Fannie Masemola are competent enough to lead the fight against crime. Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa will probe Ramaphosa on whether he intends to dissolve the Department of Public Enterprises and house state-owned enterprises (SEOs) in their respective line function departments. Ramphosa’s recent Cabinet reshuffle is also expected to feature prominently when MPs get the opportunity to ask supplementary questions during the three-hour session.
