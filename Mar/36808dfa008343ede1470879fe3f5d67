JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa will announce the long-awaited changes to his Cabinet on Monday evening, amid anticipation and pressure. His spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told journalists that Ramaphosa would address the nation at 7pm. Ramaphosa committed to restructuring his government during his State of the Nation Address (Sona), where he also announced that he would appoint a Minister of Electricity to deal with the ongoing power crisis. Magwenya defended his boss, insisting media speculation that Ramaphosa postponed reshuffling Cabinet due to a common cold only to be seen attending an Ankole cattle auction was untrue. He said that while the president was nursing the flu, he continued doing his job, including consulting around changes to his executive. Magwenya insisted that Ramaphosa understood the tasks that lay ahead. And while there was heightened anxiety and expectations ahead of changes to Cabinet, South Africans ought to be cautious and leave some room for disappointment. Though the idea of a leaner, trimmer, and meaner executive was appealing, his new team would likely be the result of juggling African National Congress (ANC) internal dynamics and the president’s own political interests, versus what he deemed best for the country. The looming 2024 general elections, which were just over a year away, were also likely to shape the changes that were made. In his own words, Ramaphosa said this moment was an opportunity to see how best various ministries and departments could serve South Africa’s national objectives.
