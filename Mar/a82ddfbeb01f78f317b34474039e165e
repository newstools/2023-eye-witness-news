The company, which was awarded a tender worth R139 million, is linked to Royal Bhaca, a company that was owned by King Thandisizwe Diko, the husband of former presidency spokesperson Khusela. Ledla argued that the tribunal was not a court and so could not adjudicate legality reviews. "We really welcome the judgment today because it has clarified the application by Ledla and we feel that it was something that needed to be done. At  the moment our lawyers are looking at the judgment so that we can understand it better and look at the way forward," said  the SIU's Kaizer Kganyago.
