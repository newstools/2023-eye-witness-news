JOHANNESBURG - National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) members at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital said that their clash with police had re-energised them to forge ahead with their strike. Demonstrating workers have been receiving medical attention inside the facility after police fired rubber bullets to disperse protesters earlier on Thursday.

"But remember, whenever there is intimidation, there will always be retaliation, which means right now they've made us now to feel like it's a do-or-die here. We are on our own as workers," said Baragwanath Hospital branch secretary, Dennis Mtshali. He said that their decision to disperse on Thursday did not mean the strike was over. "So, the struggle continues. We want to believe that the fight is just. What has happened today has given us that drive." Mtshali said that at least 11 of their members and some civilians making their way into the hospital were shot with rubber bullets.
