CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Health and Social Development departments were on Friday granted an interdict against striking public service workers affiliated to the National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu). The public service workers have been staging countrywide protests over a wage dispute. They are demanding a 10% wage increase, while government is offering 4.7%. The interdict means that workers who disrupt operations at government offices and healthcare centres can be arrested. MEC Nomafrench Mbombo said the department will also institute disciplinary proceedings against striking workers.
