JOHANNESBURG - The High Court in Pretoria has found that Tshwane Mayor Murunwa Makwarela's clearance certificate to prove he is no longer insolvent is fake. Following intense scrutiny regarding the legitimacy of the certificate, chief registrar Tumelo Ledwaba confirmed in a statement on Friday that the document in question was never issued by the court. Congress of the People member Makwarela sent the certificate to city manager Johann Mettler to show he had been rehabilitated from his debt. Last week, the discovery of his insolvency made Makwarela unfit to serve in public office. Ledwaba said the matter would be referred to the office for the Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigations and other authorities. Some in the Democratic Alliance (DA)-led multi-party coalition already claimed the paper looked forged. COALITION TO LAY CHARGES Other representatives of the metro's multi-party coalition - ActionSA, Freedom Front Plus, Inkatha Freedom Party, and African Christian Democratic Party - also said on Friday they would be laying criminal charges against Makwarela at the Brooklyn Police Station. "These charges relate to allegations that Dr Makwarela knowingly supplied falsified and fraudulent documentation to the City of Tshwane," their joint statement read. The coalition said residents had been left "dismayed" by "shameless politicking", and deserved for their elected representatives to be held accountable.
