JOHANNESBURG - Newly appointed Electricity Minister Kgosientsho Ramokgopa said he would turn to lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic to drive partnership between government and business as the country battles unprecedented load shedding. Ramokgopa joined business leaders at the launch of the Resource Mobilisation Fund (RMF) on Thursday.

This includes project management, engineering, legal, and energy modelling skills. Ramokgopa admitted that government alone did not have the capacity to end load shedding. “But also accepting that there’s a broader pool of expertise, skills that reside with the private sector. And our view that through this cooperation and collaboration, we should be able to determine those areas along the value chain where there are significant deficits in relation to technical skills in government and to the extent that we can exploit the RMF to secure those skills.”
