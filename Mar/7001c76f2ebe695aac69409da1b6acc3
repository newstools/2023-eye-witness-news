JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA)-led multiparty coalition said it identified those who betrayed their agreement by voting with the African National Congress (ANC) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to install Dr Murunwa Makwarela as the new Tshwane mayor. Coalition partners met on Thursday night to assess the results from the polygraph tests that their members were subjected to, and to plan a way forward. Makwarela, who was caught up in an insolvency debacle, defeated the DA's Cilliers Brink by securing 112 of the 213 votes cast. Brink only managed to get 101 ballots.

The coalition partners were attempting to flush out those who helped the ANC and the EFF in electing Makwarela, ahead of the election of a new speaker on Monday. “Each party will have to deal with the culprits using their own internal party processes, and we’re hoping that once this matter is resolved, we should be able to come back and be able to then give feedback to the public in terms of how we are going to deal with this matter going forward,” said DA Gauteng leader Solly Msimanga.
