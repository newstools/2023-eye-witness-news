CAPE TOWN - National Education, Health, and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) in the Western Cape said it wanted evidence that proved that a wage strike by its members resulted in the deaths of patients. Minister of Health Joe Phaahla linked four patient fatalities to the lack of medical care at some hospitals, as employees went on strike. Nehawu's Baxolise Mali said workers had a right to withdraw their services if the employer didn't listen to their demands.

The people who are alleging must come and prove that as a result of the Nehawu strike, someone died."
