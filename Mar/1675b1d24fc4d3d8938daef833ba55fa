JOHANNESBURG - The Tshwane municipal council will be meeting for a special sitting on Monday to elect a new speaker. The position became vacant last week, following the resignation of Dr Murunwa Makwarela, who is now the executive mayor. The sitting on Monday came on the back of divisions within the Democratic Alliance (DA)-led coalitions, who were trying to find councillors that betrayed it by voting for Makwarela as executive mayor in a secret ballot over their candidate, Cilliers Brink. However, members of the coalition still haven’t found the eight councillors who betrayed them and voted in the ballot. ActionSA national chairperson Michael Beaumont gave his party’s councillors until last Saturday to voluntary come forward if they broke ties with the DA-led coalition and voted with the African National Congress (ANC). Eyewitness News understood that no councillors came forward, which meant that ActionSA may consider subjecting them to lie detector tests. However, before that could happen, the coalition has another secret ballot vote to contend with on Monday. Both the DA coalition and ANC coalition had not indicated who they would be putting up for election.
