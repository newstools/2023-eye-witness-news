JOHANNESBURG - Statistics South Africa says the countryâ€™s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022. This far surpasses previous predictions by some economists of a 0.4% contraction. The biggest contributing factor is a drop in economic activity in a number of industries, notably in finance, real estate, and business services. Stats SA released the final GDP results for 2022 in Pretoria a short while ago.
