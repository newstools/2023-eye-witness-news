JOHANNESBURG - The Spar Proteas have revealed the special Netball World Cup kit they will be playing in ahead of the Netball World Cup later this year. The home and away United Warriors kit contains Puma’s Drycell technology and is inspired by the different cultures of South Africa. The Cape Town International Convention Centre will play host for the tournament, which will be hosted in Africa for the first time from 28 July to 6 August. You can view the inspirational campaign video right here:  Wearing the new kit brings a lot of excitement for the global competition, said Proteas midcourt player, Khanyisa Chawane. “Having to see the pattern around the kit, it represents us. It represents our country, it brings that feeling that the World Cup is really here and having to wear it feels really good. It does bring that excitement. Everyone wants to play in the World Cup and they know what it means to your family and to yourself to represent the country," said Chawane.       Kit manufacturer Puma South Africa's marketing director, Brett Bellinger, said that they wanted to capture all that South African was onto the kit. “We launched the home and away kits on International Women’s Day to honour women across the world and to celebrate the Women’s World Cup coming to South Africa." We will fight. We will play with pride. Because we are UNITED. And together… we are WARRIORS @Netball_SA United Warriors are ready to play. #ForeverFaster #SPARProteas pic.twitter.com/tK3CGh4LDX  The story and the meaning behind the kit design🔥🙌🏽💖✊🏽🇿🇦!
