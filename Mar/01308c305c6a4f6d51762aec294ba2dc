CAPE TOWN - President Cyril Ramaphosa said the Expropriation Bill would not be used unnecessarily to expropriate land and other property. The bill was currently before the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). It was rejected by most opposition parties in the National Assembly (NA) in 2021, but was approved last year.

The bill allowed for expropriation with nil compensation. However, Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Groenewald said that was akin to no compensation at all, which would discourage investment. “Honourable Groenewald, I can hear what you’re saying - it could be future jeopardy, but we’ve had past jeopardy on this side of the table,” Ramaphosa said. “So, some of us lived through it, but we are going to make sure that because we are a Constitutional state, it is done in terms of our laws and Constitution.” Ramaphosa said the expropriation of land was not uncommon around the world. “For those who think we will just use it willy-nilly, I just want to assure them that it’s going to be used for public purpose and for the interest of our people, and for transformational purposes.” He said he would only decide whether to subject the bill to a Constitutional review once it landed on his desk for assent.
