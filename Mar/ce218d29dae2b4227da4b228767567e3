JOHANNESBURG â€“ President Cyril Ramaphosa finally shuffled his Cabinet, but with two new positions, a bloated executive, and the amount of time it took to announce a minister of electricity, was it everything South Africans hoped for? Although Ramaphosa did not make promises of an overhaul, there were still some upsets. African National Congress (ANC) politics were a factor in how Mondli Gungubele, who was moved from being a minister in the Presidency, was seen by fellow members. New Electricity Minister Kgosientsho Ramakgopa, on the other hand, ruffled a few feathers within the cabal, with rumours of his close relationship with Deputy President Paul Mashatile. Did Ramaphosa drag his feet in reshuffling his Cabinet, and did this send the wrong message to South Africans?
