CAPE TOWN - The public protector’s office said it had already considered a report from the South African Revenue Service (Sars) that concluded there was no record of money paid to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s farm manager in 2019 being declared upon entry to South Africa. It was believed Sudanese businessman Hazim Mustafa paid Ramaphosa’s Phala Phala farm manager US$580,000 in cash for buffalo.

In response to Steenhuisen, the office repeated its response that it was in the process of finalising an interim report into the matter. Given the great deal of public interest in the matter, the public protector’s office said it was important to balance the need for transparency and integrity in the investigation. Steenhuisen believes there is no record of the money’s entry into South Africa, and that this was the reason why businessman Mustafa has never provided proof thereof. “I certainly hope the affidavit and the response from Sars will assist them now in bringing this investigation to some form of finality. It’s been long overdue, this report, and I think it’s in the interests in both the credibility of the office of the public protector, which has been severely compromised by the current incumbent, that this report needs to come out and it needs to act without fear or favour,” Steenhuisen said. He said he was also still awaiting a response from National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula for Parliament to conduct its own inquiry.
