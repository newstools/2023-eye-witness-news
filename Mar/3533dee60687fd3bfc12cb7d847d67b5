UCT spokesperson Elijah Moholola said it wasn't the university that called the police. He said officers were acting on a court order issued in February that prohibits protesting students from engaging in illegal behaviour. "The UCT executive reiterates its stance on upholding the right to legitimate protest but will act against any unlawful activities. The executive further remains committed to a process of engagement over any issues."
