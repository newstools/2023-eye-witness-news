JOHANNESBURG - The newly appointed Minister of Electricity, Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, said he would unveil an implementation plan shortly as he takes up office. Ramaokgopa, who was unveiled as the inaugural electricity minister during President Cyril Ramaphosa's Cabinet reshuffle on Monday night, is tasked with all aspects of the electricity crisis response as Eskom battles ageing infrastructure, governance issues, and dwindling generation capacity. The country's unprecedented load shedding was believed to cost the economy billions of Rands. This was what Ramaphosa said Ramokgopa needed to do in a bid to scale down the energy crisis. “Minister will work with Eskom leadership to turn around the performance of existing power stations, and to accelerate the procurement of new generation capacity, working with all colleagues,” Ramaphosa said. While Ramokgopa was yet to share the details of his implementation plan, he was expected to involve Eskom officials, the private sector, and opposition parties when he kicked off high-level talks with stakeholders. “[Will] load shedding go away tomorrow? No, it’s definitely not going to go away, but, as the Presidency said, the severity and regularity of load shedding is something that is on our radar, and we will share with you the implementation plan,” he said. “The resources… which part of society will take the lead, and ultimately as executive authority - I will drive those interventions.” Ramokgopa will be sworn into office on Wednesday.
