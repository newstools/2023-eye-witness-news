BLOEMFONTEIN - Former Transnet board member and Gupta associate Iqbal Sharma has pleaded not guilty to fraud and money laundering in the Nulane corruption trial. The trial got under way at the Bloemfontein High Court on Monday morning, where eight people are accused of defrauding the State of R25 million in a botched rural development project. All eight of the accused denied there was a case against them. At least four Free State government officials, including former rural development head Peter Thabathe, face an additional charge of contravening the Public Finance Management Act. The formal indictment read out in court detailed a long and complicated paper trail of how officials colluded with some Gupta associates to swindle the State.
