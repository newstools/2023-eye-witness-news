Dhlamini adjourned the sitting after he was surrounded by EFF councillors during a heated meeting. He said it was a shame that the council could not conduct any business on Thursday. "First and foremost, indeed, we need to apologise for that. It's not on. It's not okay. But we can't do things wrongly, we have to follow the proper processes accordingly." Dhlamini said a date for a new council meeting will be communicated within the next seven days.
