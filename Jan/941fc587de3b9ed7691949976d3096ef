JOHANNESBURG - The South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) said the increase in electricity tariffs will have a devastating effect on the poor and the working class. This after energy regulator Nersa granted Eskom an 18.65% tariff increase to be implemented from April this year. Saftu said the price hike will make electricity unaffordable for many residents.

"We are especially angry that it is South African women who mainly take care of our homes - cooking and child-rearing who must resort to supplementing electricity with firewood, coal, paraffin, gas stoves and heaters," said the trade union federation's Trevor Shaku.
