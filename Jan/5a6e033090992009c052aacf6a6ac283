CAPE TOWN - President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday said the country’s energy crisis is the price it’s paying for years of miscalculations. He added that there was no way to end load shedding overnight.

But he added that the country needs to be realistic about its challenges and what it’s going to take to fix them. A lack of investment in new generating capacity, poor power plant maintenance, corruption, criminality, sabotage, rising municipal debt and a lack of skills at Eskom created the perfect storm, Ramaphosa said. A team of independent experts was diagnosing the problems at Eskom’s coal-fired power stations. Six of them were identified for particular focus over the next six months to boost capacity.

Eskom is also looking at buying surplus power from companies with available generation for the next three years. Ramaphosa said that the huge debt owed to Eskom by municipalities is badly affecting the power utility’s ability to fund critical maintenance.
