JOHANNESBURG - As small business buckle under the pressure of load shedding, others have had to close down.

On Tuesday, one of the businesses shut its doors, with others on the brink of collapse. Load shedding has left many people in South Africa frustrated, as they have had to adjust to spending at least eight hours minimum without electricity. For the people who sell food for a living, this has had a major impact on their businesses. READ: Load shedding: small business owners are losing money A woman who sells vetkoek said long hours without power meant spending most of her profit replacing spoiled stock. "Once most of the things are spoilt we have to throw the food away and rebuy as you can't serve people spoilt food." Meanwhile, Mabel who sells Kota and dagwood said she bought ingredients daily to reduce the amount of food that had to be thrown away. "It's a matter of doing hand-to-mouth. We buy, we use and do not buy too much stock so we buy just enough for a day or two." Unfortunately, another business owner Xolani who used to run an internet cafe on Sanders Road had to close down because he was not profiting. Most of the small businesses used gas for most of the day but were still expected to pay for electricity.
