The price hike would take effect in April. The increase was almost half of Eskom's call for a 32% tariff increase. In the same multi-year price determination application, Eskom asked Nersa for a further 22% increase for the 2024/25 financial year.

It was understood the electricity subcommittee took Eskom's diesel costs into account while balancing the rising cost of living. Nersa chairperson Thembani Bukula admitted it was a difficult decision. "These challenges are expected to affect South Africa's economic activity in the short, medium and even longer term", said Bukula. Meanwhile, Eskom implemented stage 6 load shedding indefinitely, citing generating constraints.
