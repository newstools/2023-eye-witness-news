JOHANNESBURG - Union Saccawu and retail giant Massmart will be heading back to the CCMA for a facilitation process to try and resolve an ongoing wage dispute. The two parties have been in a nine-month-long wage dispute, with Saccawu going on multiple protests over the last year. Massmart had previously said that it had closed the wage negotiations because the union wouldn't budge. The union is demanding a 12% wage increase and R8,000 minimum wage. It said that it would also picket outside the CCMA offices on Wednesday. Saccawu spokesperson, Sithembele Tshwete: "They'll be meeting to try and resolve the current dispute over wages and working conditions."
