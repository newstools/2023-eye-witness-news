JOHANNESBURG - The South African Police Service (SAPS) sent a stern warning against the unauthorised use of SAPS property, adding that such act constitute criminal offences. This after a video circulated on social media showing a civilian flaunting police uniform posing in an official police vehicle. The police service warned members of the public against falsely representing themselves as law enforcement authorities. “Civilians are therefore discouraged from using or wearing police property to avoid having a criminal record. This civilian has committed at least three offences. This unauthorised use of SAPS property and uniform is a direct contravention of the SAPS Act,” said the police’s Athlenda Mathe.
