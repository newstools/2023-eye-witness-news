JOHANNESBURG - If newly-elected Joburg mayor Thapelo Amad performs well in the metro, it could grow Al Jama-ah's party membership across the country, one political analyst has predicted. Rebone Tau said the Al Jama-ah councillor's rise to mayor will shine a spotlight on the minority party. Amad was elected mayor on Friday after the removal of the DA's Mpho Phalatse in a no-confidence vote. "You must remember that 2024 is coming. Then what does that mean for minority parties in 2024? That means that they will get a sizeable number and we will see an increment of support in different communities," said Tau. Currently, Al Jama-ah only has three seats in the Joburg city council.
