JOHANNESBURG - The elderly and people with comorbidities should wear masks as a preventative measure, experts have warned, after South Africa registered its first case of the new COVID-19 Omicron subvariant. While most scientists said South Africa had largely achieved immunity to Omicron, health organisation Higher Health CEO Ramneek Ahluwalia urged vulnerable persons to exercise caution. "Wear masks in overcrowded spaces as well as less ventilated areas. Vaccination is still one of the best tools we have available to us, so we do urge South Africans to get vaccinated, if they haven't done so already, and for those who have to please follow up with their booster doses," Higher Health's Danielle Melville said.
