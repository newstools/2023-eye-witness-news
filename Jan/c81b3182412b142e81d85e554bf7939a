CAPE TOWN - The ANC parliamentary caucus says its murder accused MP, Sibusiso Kula, is expected to follow the ANC step-aside guidelines since he is facing criminal charges. Chief whip Pemmy Majodina’s office said the caucus noted the arrest and court appearance Kula, who was charged last week and appeared in connection with the murder of his wife, Jennifer Motlhomi. The caucus said it took gender-based violence seriously, and was deeply saddened by Motlhomi’s murder.
