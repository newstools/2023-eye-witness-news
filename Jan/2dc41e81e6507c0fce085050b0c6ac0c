JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) said the country’s migration laws must be overhauled. ANC national executive committee (NEC) member David Mahlobo said this was one of resolutions taken by the party’s Peace and Stability commission during its 55th national elective conference. Mahlobo said the ANC does not support xenophobia against foreigners who live in the country. He said that the legislation needed to be clear on how law enforcement entities deal with asylum seekers, immigrants, and refugees. “We agreed that laws are being overhauled," said Mahlobo. "All the migration laws we'll engage with the United Nations so that we can be able to put certain conditions around the ascension that we did make but at the very same time our view remains: Africa remains one. We must integrate." ANC NEC Member, David Mahlobo, says the ANC’s Peace and Stability commission resolved that the country’s migration laws must be overhauled. However Mahlobo says that the ANC’s message remains that (paraphrase) ‘everyone is welcome to South Africa’ TCG  At the party's recently-held 55th national conference at Nasrec, last month, Deputy Minister of State Security and ANC NEC member, Zizi Kodwa, said that the country's citizenship, refugee and immigration acts all needed to be overhauled and reviewed. "Without being xenophobic, we need to create domestic stability in the country. I think an uncontrolled migration and everybody else may create social instability in the country as we have seen now." Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said that the ANC had a policy paper calling for the country's citizenship, refugee and immigration acts to all be reviewed. "The system that is happening now with our immigration is not sustainable, it can't go on forever."
