CAPE TOWN - Health experts have cautioned South Africans that it is too early to panic over the new COVID-19 Omicron subvariant, dubbed "Kraken". Health Minister Joe Phaahla was expected to provide an update on Tuesday on the COVID-19 situation in the country. "The ministry will use this opportunity to respond to a number of topical issues, including the discovery of a new variant called XBB.1.5, which has dominated the media space and also created public panic in the past few days," said health department spokesperson Foster Mohale. So far, the so-called Kraken variant - not it's scientific name - has been confirmed in 28 countries. The World Health Organization said it was the most transmissible subvariant to date. But local professor Tulio de Oliveria, from the KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and sequencing platform - or Krisp - is of the view that the new variant will not cause much of a disruption to South Africa. He said we had achieved a high population immunity.
