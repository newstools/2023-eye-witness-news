CAPE TOWN - The Minister of Higher Education, Science, and Technology, Blade Nzimande, said that the issue of student placement at institutions should not be politicised. The department said that more than 1.1 million students applied for funding from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) for 2023. Nzimande said that, in reality, only around 800,000 prospective students would be granted funding. However, he said that this was still a significant number.

The minister emphasised that through its various programmes, government contributes to a massive increase in the number of students accessing tertiary studies.

Meanwhile, the Economic Freedom Fighters Student Command will be embarking on a 16-hour march to the Union Buildings on Wednesday to highlight issues around student debt and funding.
