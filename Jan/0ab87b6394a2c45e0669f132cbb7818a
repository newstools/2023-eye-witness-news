They bemoaned the National Energy Regulator’s decision to allow Eskom to implement an 18.65% price hike for the 2023/2024 financial year, adding that already cash-strapped consumers would have to pay more for electricity that they did not use. Sasria said the country is still recovering from the devastating 2021 July unrest that cost over R32 billion rand in damages.

We can handle that within Sasria but anything above that amount will again require the taxpayers to assist Sasria.”
