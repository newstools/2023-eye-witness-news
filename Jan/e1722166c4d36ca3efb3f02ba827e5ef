JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) said that considering the growing number of pupils who drop out of school, the actual 2022 matric pass rate was only 54.6% and not the purported overall pass rate of 80.1%. The party said that over 330,000 pupils dropped out of grade 12 in 2022 - with the dropout rate for the 2022 matric class at 31.8%. Speaking at the Centre for Learning on Evaluation and Results in Johannesburg on Thursday, the DA's Baxolile Nodada said that unless the Department of Basic Education addressed the issues of the high drop-out rate and the ineffective curriculum that failed to support pupils, the future of the majority of matriculants would be very bleak. "This is something that’s very important in our congratulatory mood that we are honest about the assessment of these outcomes and account for them because they drop out and then they join the… young South Africans who are unemployed. We need to empower them so that they can be prosperous in the future. "As much as we can purport an 80% pass rate, what is the real quality outcome? Where can those learners go in terms of the skills that they’ve acquired in this particular NSC [National Senior Certificate]?” The 2022 matric results are an improvement of 3.7% from 2021. Moreover, the 80.1% is the second highest since 2019. The 2022 cohort also attained the highest number of bachelor passes in the history of the NSC exams. Quality assurance body Umalusi gave the results a thumbs up. But Nodada said the party's own calculations-based dropout rates tell a different story. "The real 2022 matric pass rate is only 54.6%," he said. The DA also called for the Department of Basic Education to address what it calls the twin issues of high dropout rates and ineffective curriculum. Meanwhile, the Economic Freedom Fighters welcomed the outcome but the party also wants the department to account for the pupils who fell through the cracks due to unfavourable learning conditions.
