CAPE TOWN - President Cyril Ramaphosa says load shedding cannot be stopped overnight, but that he understands the frustration the power cuts are causing South Africans. In his first weekly newsletter for 2023, Ramaphosa said the country needed to be realistic about its problems. He said the havoc wreaked on businesses, the farming, health, education and the justice sectors as a result of load shedding was undeniable, and wanted an immediate end to the power outages. But the president conceded the country was in an energy crisis many years in the making, and that the response needed to tackle the causes of the crisis, and not just its symptoms.
