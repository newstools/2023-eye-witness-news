JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC’s) national chairperson Gwede Mantashe said decisions of the party's Free State leadership will always be challenged in the courts because provincial members are ill-disciplined. This comes after the registration for the ninth provincial elective conference in Bloemfontein was temporarily halted on Friday,  after a group of party members  disrupted the process. The delegates are expected to elect their new leaders after several postponements last year due to legal wrangling. The Free State, along with the Western Cape, were the only two that could not convene their conferences before the party’s national conference last month. The numerous delays in the province have been attributed to conflicts between branches that were still loyal to former Free State leader Ace Magashule and branches advocating for the party's renewal agenda. Mantashe said systems must be put in place to restore order in the provincial structures. “We must keep our eyes open. This province is so important. Nobody talks about it because the province itself has undercut itself and underplayed its role. This you can do comrades by putting in systems, processes and resources to fight any sign of these risks that I have listed.” As you meet here as delegates to the 09th #ANCFSConference, you must seek to have an agreement on organisational matters. The culture of walkouts when we disagree, is another culture that we must overcome. Comrades must get used to engaging one another pic.twitter.com/FXQuG1J5xS  Mantashe also urged ANC members in the province to elect people who will move the province forward. "You must elect a leadership of the Free State who will drive the programme of revitalising the Free State, please. Irrespective of factions."
