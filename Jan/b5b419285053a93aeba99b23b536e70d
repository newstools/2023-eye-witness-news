JOHANNESBURG - Joburg City Power has disconnected the electricity supply to a 26-unit residential property in Alexandra. It said that the landlord had an illegal connection. The property, which is situated on First Street, used to be a supermarket before being turned into an accommodation space. It was disconnected during City Power's revenue collection drive on defaulting businesses on Tuesday. Resident, Pulani Mokoena, said that she paid R800 a month for electricity to her landlord for her one-bedroom unit. She said that she was shocked that the landlord had not been paying for electricity. "When we first moved in here, I was surprised the electricity is overcharging, so then I had to get a gas bottle. R800 is quite a lot and that is what the electrician said to us." Mokoena said that she lived with her two children and her husband. "Well, I've been coping since I have a gas bottle, but now the challenge is going to be like I have food for like throughout the whole month and it is going to be difficult," Mokoena explained. Eyewitness News was not able to reach the landlord for comment.
