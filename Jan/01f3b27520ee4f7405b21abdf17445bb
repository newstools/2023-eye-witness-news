JOHANNESBURG - City of Tshwane said that it continuously communicated with Eskom about its financial challenges and was currently implementing interventions to address them. These sentiments come after Eskom published a statement, stating that the city owed the utility R1.4 billion as of Wednesday. The city said that it acknowledged the debt and had proposed a payment plan with Eskom to bring the account up to date. However, it added that Eskom's rolling power cuts also played a role on the city's liquidity position. It said that its maintenance budget was out of control as a direct impact of the power cuts. City of Tshwane's MMC for finance, Peter Sutton: "One has to acknowledge the impact of load shedding on the City of Tshwane. Our residents and business are battling to make ends meet. We see a devastation of our economy."
