JOHANNESBURG - Rand Water has restricted water supply to the City of Tshwane by implementing flow control measures. This is after residents failed to heed the call to use water sparingly.

"While we have not yet implemented additional water restrictions, they will likely be necessary unless we can lower our city's water consumption. At the moment we are asking residents for assistance to avoid the situation worsening. I realise this is difficult with the high temperatures, but we must work to avoid the challenges we experienced in October last year when the temperatures were not as high," said utility services MMC Daryl Johnston.
