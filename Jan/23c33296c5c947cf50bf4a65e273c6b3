CAPE TOWN - The Gupta family's former Cape Town mansion is up for sale. The sprawling property in the upmarket Constantia suburb is expected to fetch at least R20 million. The seven-bedroom, six-bathroom house is situated on prime real estate in the upper Constantia area.   The house was once owned by Mark Thatcher, the son of the former British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher.

The property, however, has fallen into a severe state of disrepair having remained vacant for a number of years. A one-minute video posted on the property agent's website offers an aerial view of the exterior of the dilapidated thatched-roof house, set among high trees in an overgrown garden. A filthy green pool, gaping holes in the thatched roof and water damage to the interior point to years of neglect.  The 8,000 square metre erf also contains a one-bedroom cottage, a guard house, domestic quarters and a pool room. The house was once owned by Mark Thatcher, the son of the former British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher.

So, I think someone can take the structure of it. Obviously, it needs a new roof, everything inside needs to be stripped back but I believe the structure of the property is solid." Hardie said there was a steady stream of interest in the property, which was going for a fraction of what properties were worth in one of the city's prime residential streets.
