CAPE TOWN â€“ "We love PelÃ©, but we also have our own legends." That was the sentiment of most social media users. It followed Fifa boss Gianni Infantinoâ€™s proposal that all 211 of their member associations name one of their stadiums in PelÃ©â€™s honour. A post shared by Gianni Infantino - FIFA President (@gianni_infantino)  "Now, we need to make sure that we â€“ the world of football â€“ remember PelÃ© forever. Young people around the world have to know and remember who PelÃ© was, and the happiness he gave," he said in a social media post. PelÃ© died on 29 December 2022 at the age of 82, following a long battle with cancer. A post shared by Gianni Infantino - FIFA President (@gianni_infantino)  "In 100 yearsâ€™ time, when goals are scored in the PelÃ© stadium in any country in the world and people ask who he was, they will hear that he was a unique player who brought joy and happiness to us all."  Infantino added. Mzansi took to social media asking that local heroes be honoured first before the country even considers Infantinoâ€™s proposal. We love King Pele but we also have our own legends and departed heroes. Ace Motsoeleng, Jomo Sono, Kaizer Motaung, Lucas Radebe and many more. Can we honour these local legends first pls  We have our own legends, Bo Jomo Sono, Lucas Radebe, Sibusiso Zuma, etc  Why should we, I mean... We don't even have a stadia named after our own G. O. A. T Ntate Jomo Sono.  Let them build their own Stadium that they can name after Pele, we have our own legends that have not been honoured in the country...  Why would he be named in South African stadium when he is not SA citizen? Pele is a legend but please respect South Africans ðŸš®
