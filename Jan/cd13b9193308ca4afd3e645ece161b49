JOHANNESBURG - Power utility, City Power said it was planning to cut back its dependence on Eskom this year and it planned to do so by sourcing alternative energy power providers. According to the electricity distributor, partnering with Eskom had become too costly, since it began losing R3.6million every day due to load shedding. The utility said power cuts crippled its electricity infrastructure last December's weeks-long heavy rains worsening the crisis. City Power was still trying to respond to a backlog of 5000 outage calls – which had been delayed as repairs could not be carried out when there is no power.

Speaking on behalf of the utility, spokesperson Isaac Mangena said the company was moving away from Eskom. “Not completely moving away but have options for electricity replacements like gas and solar supply in the coming few years – [we’re] currently in the process of recruiting assistance for this,” Mangena said.
