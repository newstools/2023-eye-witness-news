JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg city councillors on Friday sat to vote for a new mayor. This came after the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Mpho Phalatse was ousted at Thursday’s extraordinary council meeting. The councillors nominated three candidates to run for the position: Phalatse, with the hope of her being re-elected, the Al Jama-ah’s Thapelo Amad and ActionSA’s Funzi Ngobeni. - READ: DA RESPONSIBLE FOR PHALATSE'S REMOVAL AS JOBURG MAYOR, SAYS ACTIONSA African National Congress (ANC) councillors were singing songs of liberation since the council meeting began on Friday morning, with confidence that the voting process would go their way.
