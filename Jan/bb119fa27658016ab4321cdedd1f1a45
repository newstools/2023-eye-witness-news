CAPE TOWN - The case against a nurse implicated in the murder of a police officer in Cape Town's Khayelitsha has been postponed to the end of January for bail information. The 40-year-old man made his first appearance in the Khayelitsha Magistrate's Court on Tuesday after handing himself over to police. He allegedly stabbed 37-year-old Captain Siphumeza Lusasa to death along Spine Road on Saturday. According to the Hawks, the attack apparently happened after the police officer had an argument with the accused's girlfriend. A member of the public, who was on the scene, rushed the officer to hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. He had been stabbed several times.
