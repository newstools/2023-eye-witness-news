In that part, matric was even busier trying to get on top of everything.” So, what's next for the country's top achiever? “I’m actually going to be studying actuarial science, probably at UCT, so we’ll see. I’m hoping that I enjoy it, I love my maths, obviously, so I’m sure I will. So, yeah, I’ll see where the wind takes me.” Matriculants will get their individual results on Friday.
