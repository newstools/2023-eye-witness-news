Legal analyst advocate Mannie Witz said the law firm will have to adequately prove that these entities are guilty of negligence in some way. “It's quite a complex matter to deal with, and I think it would first be better to see what the merits of the case are before you decide on the amount of the claim.” ALSO READ: GP health MEC disappointed with lack of accountability for Boksburg explosion Another analyst Mpumelelo Zikalala shared the same sentiments. “They will first need to certify that particular class action and see what type of matter they are dealing with and the type of damages they are dealing [with], and then they can try and quantify them.” This comes as many have expressed concern about the lack of accountability regarding the blast.
