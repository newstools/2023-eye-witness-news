CAPE TOWN - Technology management researcher, David Walwyn, said that alleged criminal elements at Eskom power stations must be driven out for the power utility to function optimally. Walwyn recently penned a News24 opinion piece titled Fixing Eskom requires cleansing the sector of the 'energy mafia'. Speaking to CapeTalk on Monday morning, Walwyn, a University of Pretoria professor of technology management, said that available evidence showed that the situation at Eskom was indicative of it having lost control of its coal-fired power stations. Walwyn claimed that criminals had been allowed to infiltrate these power stations. "There are 15 coal-fired power stations and I think every single one has been infiltrated by these criminal elements. "I think sabotage then is misleading. This is criminality," Walwyn said.
