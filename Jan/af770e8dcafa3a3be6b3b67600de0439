JOHANNESBURG - The death toll in the Boksburg gas tanker explosion has risen to 40. Thursday marked 20 days since the tanker explosion. Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi said during a briefing on the latest updates on the blast that since the tragedy, three more people who were hospitalised succumbed to their injuries.

"We owe it to the many lives that have been lost and the many people that have been injured, including the many affected families, to see to it that justice prevails. Painful as this chapter is, it must end with justice being served. "Justice being served means that there must be people held accountable for the tragic loss of life, and families need to find closure."
