JOHANNESBURG - The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) has banned former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste from serving as a director on any company listed on the JSE for the next 20 years. This is part of the JSE's public censure against Jooste, who was at the centre of the country's biggest accounting fraud scandal. The JSE has also fined Jooste R15 million for violations of the listing requirements and submitting false financial statements. The JSE said that Jooste failed to fulfil his duties and responsibilities as the chief executive officer of Steinhoff in ensuring that the listed companies complied with the listing requirements. The JSE penalised Jooste R7.5 million for releasing financial statements that did not comply with the international financial reporting standards and the listing requirements and contained incorrect, false and misleading statements. The other R7.5 million fine is for a fraudulent transaction where he used a handwritten note to instruct the then financial officer, Ben la Grange, to approve a bogus transaction that inflated Steinhoff's income to more than R375 million. On Tuesday, the Financial Services Tribunal judge, Louis Harms, dismissed Jooste's application against the censure. Harms only upheld Jooste's appeal against the fines, which will be argued at a later date. The JSE said that it would await the outcome of the reconsideration application in relation to the enforcement of the fines, which it said it would oppose.
