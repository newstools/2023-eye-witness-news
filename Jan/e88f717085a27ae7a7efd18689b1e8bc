Mashatile said the new ANC leadership was committed to renewing the party. “We have appointed a committee that is looking at those issues. They are going to brief the NEC when it meets and then once we get the briefing we will probably come up with the time frames but in general it is agreed that our comrades who are affected should respond accordingly - those who are implicated yes.” Paul Mashatile, ANC Deputy President, says the party has established a commission which will deal with ANC members implicated in the state capture commission.
