JOHANNESBURG - South Africans are waking up with slightly less pressure on their petrol budget. Both grades of fuel have now dropped by R2.06 a litre, while diesel costs between R2.81 and R2.68 less. You will pay R1.93 less for illuminating paraffin. The Energy Department said the drop is due to the recent average Brent crude oil price decreases.
