JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said that the party would look at ways to improve the racial mix of its leadership. All the members in the ANC's top seven are black, with minimal representation of minority races within the 80 additional national executive committee (NEC) members. Mbalula said that the ANC was a non-racial party and its leadership makeup needed to reflect the country's population. The secretary-general addressed the media at a briefing ahead of the party's 111th birthday celebrations on 8 January. Mbalula said that the ANC could not afford to be seen as an African-only party. He said that the current ANC leadership was a reflection of nominations from branches. Mbalula said that the party did not have policies that legislated the racial makeup of leadership compared to its 50/50 gender-parity policy. â€œThe collective of the national executive committee will apply its mind and make recommendations. If we have to co-opt, we will co-opt. We are not an Africanist party - we are black in general and African in particular." According to a 2019 report by the Pew Research Centre, black South Africans had a significantly favourable view of the ANC when compared to other races. Meanwhile, one of the opposition parties, the Democratic Alliance (DA), was favoured by white South Africans. WATCH: Mbalula: There is no crisis, we are functioning
