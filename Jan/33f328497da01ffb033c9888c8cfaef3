JOHANNESBURG: Jacob Maroga was only five months into the job as Eskom CEO when load shedding was first introduced to South Africans in 2007. Almost 16 years later, Maroga said the short-term goal for the power utility should be to raise its energy availability factor to at least 75% of the maximum capacity available. “Unless we solve the baseload crisis in the short-medium term, we may not even see the long term, we may not even see the transition," he said. Maroga said Eskom’s energy vision should be underpinned by economic insight. He said government needs to decide whether Eskom produces electricity for profit or as a baseline for economic development.
