CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town says it will cost the municipality R1.3 million to fix one of its MyCiTi buses after it was set alight in Hout Bay on Wednesday. The incident is believed to be in retaliation after city traffic officers pulled over a minibus taxi to check for permits in Hout Bay, Cape Town. Police told Eyewitness News that a taxi driver was arrested for a traffic violation and for assaulting a traffic officer. It's believed that the other taxi drivers then stoned a passing MyCiTi bus filled with passengers, and set it alight. No injuries were reported, and the City has since opened a criminal case. The City's Mayco member for urban mobility Rob Quintas said their top priority right now is the safety of drivers and commuters. "Currently we are looking at an escorted service into that area for the foreseeable future, until some headway is made with the taxi operators." Quintas said they won't tolerate any attacks on their buses. "In these hard times where Capetonians have to battle unemployment, constant load shedding, and a high cost of living, we will do all we can to ensure our commuters can count on us for a reliable and safe public transport service."
