JOHANNESBURG - An outcome was expected on Thursday afternoon after energy regulator Nersa concluded high-level deliberations over Eskom's revenue application which could see households and businesses pay higher prices for electricity. READ: Stage 6 load shedding confirmed 'until further notice' The power utility requested a 32% increase in electricity tariffs for the 2023/24 financial year and an additional 9% in 2024/25. Nersa's electricity committee was expected to deliver the outcome of Eskom's application later in the afternoon. It was understood that the hefty increase came as the cash-strapped utility looked to cover generation costs as it battled with debt. If Eskomâ€™s fifth revenue application was granted, the 32% tariff hike would take effect at the start of April. Nersa could also decide to grant only part of that amount - as they did in April last year when electricity increased by almost 10% - instead of the 20% requested by Eskom. Meanwhile, Eskom implemented stage six load shedding indefinitely as it faces operational constraints.
