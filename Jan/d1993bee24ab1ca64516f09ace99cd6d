Cosatu said the growing economic pressure on households could see low-earning workers lose their homes and cars. The federation added that the sustainability of small businesses is also under threat, with workers at risk of losing their jobs if business owners can't keep their doors open. Cosatu also accused the government of leaving poor families to their own devices, adding that the government must find and address the root causes of the ailing economy.
