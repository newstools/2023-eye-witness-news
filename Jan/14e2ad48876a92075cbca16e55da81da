JOHANNESBURG - The  African National Congress (ANC) in Johannesburg on Thursday said it won't run for the mayoral position again should Mayor Mpho Phalatse be ousted. Phalatse faces three motions-of-no confidence after three minority parties including the African Transformation Movement, African Independent Congress and Al Jama-ah each tabled a motion.
