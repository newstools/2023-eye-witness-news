CAPE TOWN - The Gordon's Bay Muslim Society said that space for Muslim burials was again becoming scarce in Cape Town. It said that the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to many deaths, contributed to the shortage of graveyard space.

Peer said that they want to be prepared, should disaster strike. "At this stage, we're not ready. The new place is not ready. We only got an interim 140, which is very tiny, in the event of a pandemic, but in the absence of a pandemic, I think we should be okay."
