Instead, he took the day to move house with a friend to Pretoria. "I realised that I couldn't afford my rent at the end of the month, and they would put me out on the street, so I had to make quick arrangements to move." Ackerman said he only went to the doctor on Friday where he claims to have received a medical certificate but said that was misplaced with his wallet. Judge Ismail Mohamed questioned why he could not get his friend to take him to the doctor on Thursday. The state has argued that Ackerman violated his bail conditions, but he claims those were amended. The matter has been postponed to Wednesday when it will be established whether or not that amendment was made.
