The office has been investigating complaints from the ATM that President Cyril Ramaphosa may have breached the Constitution and anti-corruption laws. This relates to the theft of  $580, 000 from his Limpopo farm, said to be the proceeds of a game transaction. "After the conclusion of the PPSA’s quality assurance processes, the preliminary report will be issued to the affected parties to the investigation, and will not be made available to the public," said the acting spokesperson for the Public Protector’s office, Ndili Msoki. The Public Protector’s office said the process has to be followed to ensure the decision it takes on the investigation is lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair. "Once the process post-issuance of the preliminary report has been concluded including quality assurance, the final report will be published in terms of Section 8.1 of the PP [Public Protector] Act read with section 182 1 (b) of the Constitution."
