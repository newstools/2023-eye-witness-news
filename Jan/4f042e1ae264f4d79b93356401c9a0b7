JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) has accused the Democratic Alliance (DA) of grandstanding over the country's energy crisis. The official opposition has started marching towards the ANC's Luthuli House in Johannesburg to demonstrate against power cuts. Hundreds of DA supporters have now gathered at the Mary Fitzgerald square in the Joburg CBD. They are expected to start marching towards Luthuli House within this hour.

The number of ANC Youth League supporters outside Luthuli House appears to be increasing. The DA has not yet arrived.

It said, therefore, the ANC was responsible for frequent power cuts and wanted it to take accountability. But the ANCYL said the DA was misguided. "There is no political party anywhere that must think they can come to another and march to another political party's headquarters on matters of governance that have nothing to do with the political office," the league's national organiser, Tlangi Mogale, said. Mogale said the DA should rather consider protesting at Eskom offices or provide workable solutions to address the energy crisis. Earlier, DA leader John Steenhuisen said Luthuli House was "ground zero" of South Africa's electricity crisis. "If you're serious about tackling the problem, you need to go straight to the source of the problem, and Luthuli House is ground zero of the electricity crisis in South Africa. "That's where the destruction of Eskom was engineered, through the terrible outdated policy, through disgusting greed and corruption, and above all, through the deployment of useless and criminal cadres to the power utility."
