JOHANNESBURG - Former president Jacob Zuma has been elected as South African National Civic Organisation's (Sanco’s) chairperson in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). The 80-year-old was elected to the position at the civic organisation's provincial conference in Durban on Friday. Concerns have been raised over the former head of state’s ability to lead the organisation due to his age and health condition. Zuma was arrested for contempt of court in 2021 but only served two months of his sentence, after he was granted medical parole due to a terminal illness. As the newly elected chairperson of Sanco, the 80-year-old’s role is to address the social issues experienced by communities in the province. Sanco’s provincial secretary Thulani Gamede defended Zuma’s appointment, saying that his age will not affect his performance as Sanco’s provincial chairperson as he was more than capable of handling the job. “He is (soon to be) 81-years-old but you can see that the man is still fresh, even when he takes to the podium, he speaks volumes, so I don't see anything wrong with president Zuma.” BREAKING NEWS: Former President Jacob Zuma has been elected chairperson of SANCO in KwaZulu-Natal. @NkoRaphael pic.twitter.com/fMXQJSMywQ  Meanwhile, Gamede said the new leadership would fight for quality education in the province as it was concerned about the state of public schools in the province. He said the COVID-19 pandemic had had a negative impact on basic and higher education schooling facilities. “The education gap is still there so we need to make sure that we close that gap. Having educated young people, by now we would have had solutions rather than complaining that we have load shedding.”
