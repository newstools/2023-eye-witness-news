JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa will hold a series of emergency meetings this week in a bid to resolve the country's worsening energy crisis, his office said. Ramaphosa cancelled his trip to Switzerland, where he was meant to lead the South African delegation to the World Economic Forum summit, to urgently attend to the crisis back home. In a short statement posted on social media, presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said Ramaphosa had already met with the leadership of Eskom and the national energy crisis committee. He was also expected to meet with leaders of political parties represented in Parliament.
