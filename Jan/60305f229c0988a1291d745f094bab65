NQUTHU - Former president Jacob Zuma says those running government need to take the citizens of the country seriously, and respect them. Zuma was responding to King Misuzulu’s remarks during the Isandlwana commemoration in Nquthu, Northern KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday. This was after the Zulu monarch's address at the historic event at the battlefield. In his address, King MisuZulu urged his subjects to respect and pray for government officials, including President Cyril Ramaphosa. “Let us not judge, let us not point fingers, his job is not an easy task - please with all the politics happening, pray for our leaders all the time.” However, Zuma said ordinary people also deserve government’s respect. “I’d like to touch base on what your highness said about respecting government, when I heard the king say that - I thought to myself if only government could be told to respect the people.” Zuma said it was important for those in power to remember they are serving people and not themselves. RELATED:  Meanwhile, Zulu Traditional Prime Minister Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi said there needed to be unity in order to eliminate challenges facing the country. Buthelezi also spoke at the Saturday commemoration - the first following the ascension of King Misuzulu to the throne last year. Buthelezi said a lot can be achieved through unity, adding that the ongoing challenges in the country could be overcome through unity. "As we face a crippling economy, corruption, and abuse of power by government, severe power cuts, lack of water, high costs of living and high unemployment rate, we need to be brave in order to face these challenges."
