Spokesperson for the Department of Health Foster Mohale said learners displaying symptoms would be sent home to contain the spread. “The department of health is urging parents and caregivers to ensure children are fully immunised against childhood diseases such as measles", he said. Chief of communications and partnerships at Unicef SA,  Toby Fricker said malnutritioned children were at greater risk of suffering fatal complications should they contract the disease. “This is concerning because it is happening against a background of routine immunisation coverage that is not optimal which means there are more people, children and young children who are susceptible to measles infections”, he said. The National Institute For Communicable Diseases Of South Africa had not recorded any fatalities.
