JOHANNESBURG - Joburg Water says it has taken note of a complaint by a Johannesburg resident that the water coming from her taps is blue. The resident shared a picture and video on social media on Sunday, which has since been shared widely. Joburg Water says it has been in touch with the resident and will be investigating the matter. It says it suspects that the blue colour may be caused by the levels of copper in the building. "We have since sent the customer details to our lab, they will be taking samples from the meter because that's where we supply and be advised further. We shall wait for the results from our lab" said Joburg water spokesperson Puleng Mopeli. Thereâ€™s some coming out now again and theyâ€™re still blue, just lighter in colour â€¦ angisazi.@CityofJoburgZA @JHBWater can anyone at least let us know what this blue colour is in the water? Is it normal or safe? We are still water shedding in our area btw ðŸ™ƒ pic.twitter.com/UrcTELA8T5
