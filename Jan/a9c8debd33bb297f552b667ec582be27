JOHANNESBURG - Opposition parties and organisations said Eskom’s announcement to consider keeping load shedding at a minimum of stage 2 and stage 3  over the next two years will undoubtedly plunge the country into poverty, food instability and economic ruin. The Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Transvaal Agricultural Union are calling on the government to exempt farmers from load shedding as the latest extended stages continue to wreak havoc on farming operations, tipping food security to the edge. The DA in Gauteng said the province was severely impacted by the disruptions in the agricultural sector caused by the relentless power cuts.

This government to urgently assist our farmers with tax incentives and rebates and an emergency fund to assist with this load shedding crisis to ensure that we keep food on the table for our residents.”
