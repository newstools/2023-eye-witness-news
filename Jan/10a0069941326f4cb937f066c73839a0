It was on this day in 1912 that a group of black delegates from four provinces met to formulate a protest against apartheid laws. Delegates included Saul Msane, Josiah Gumede, John Dube, Pixley ka Isaka Seme and Sol Plaaitje. It was one of the most significant moments of black protest politics. On this day, 8 January in 1912, at the Waaihoek Wesleyan Church in Bloemfontein, several members incl. Josiah Gumede, John Dube, Pixley ka Isaka Seme & Sol Plaatje, gathered to form the African National Congress, then called the South African Native National Congress. #ANC111 pic.twitter.com/VIc41q9sKO  The prestigious Waaihoek Church sits at the foot of the massive Bloemfontein cooling towers. While it is well-kept, it is surrounded by dilapidated buildings, potholes, and litter strewn across the street. The church was declared a national heritage site in 2018 but the Manguang metro now wants it to be declared an international heritage site.
