CAPE TOWN - Residents of Paarl must do more to ensure that the Boland town's women and children are protected, a local community leader, Edgar Petersen, has said. Petersen's comments came after the body of a girl, 10, was discovered at a house in Mbekweni in Paarl just over a week ago. It's believed an accused in the murder, a relative of the deceased, then handed himself over to police. He appeared in court on Monday, a day after little Lihle Zenzile was laid to rest. It's the second child murder in that region in as many months. In September, the body of Tamia Botha, four, was found on a school field. Her family had reported her missing a day before at the Paarl East Police Station.
