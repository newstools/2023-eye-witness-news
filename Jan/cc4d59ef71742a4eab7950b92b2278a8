JOHANNESBURG - The repo rate has been raised by 25 basis points meaning that the prime lending rate is going to be 10.75%. South African Reserve bank governor Lesetja Kganyago announced this on Thursday following a meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) "The MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 7.25% per annum with effect from the 27th of January 2023. Three members of the committee preferred the announced increase [while] two members preferred a 50 basis points increase," he said. Kganyago said there are serious concerns about economic growth with load shedding taking its toll. "Investment is still positive but is revised down due to weaker confidence and lower growth than we previously expected." However, he said that the situation can be turned around: "A material reduction in load shedding would significantly raise growth." Kganyago also said that inflation was high due to a number of factors, adding that it needed to be addressed. "Increases in electricity and food prices inflation and higher headline inflation for 2022 keep the headline inflation forecast elevated in the near and medium term."
