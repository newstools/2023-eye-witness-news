CAPE TOWN - The Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) said that the later-than-usual release of matric results is not expected to  impact academic operations at universities. The matric results are expected to be released on 19 January. Higher Education spokesperson Ishmael Mnisi said measures are in place to mitigate any negative outcome. â€œYou know, when we look at the processes of new entry administration, our institutions, they start as early as June/July to accept new learners into the courses, prospective courses, and they get accepted preliminarily on the basis of their mid-year results." Meanwhile, the South African Union of Students (SAUS) said that the COVID-19 pandemic should not be used as an excuse for underperforming students.
