CAPE TOWN - A protest march to the African National Congress headquarters and a planned class action lawsuit against Eskom and the Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan are on the cards. This comes as the country experiences unprecedented levels of load shedding with Stage 6 blackouts implemented until further notice.

Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen said his party is organising a major protest to take place at the ANC’s Luthuli House headquarters to protest the ongoing load shedding.

"Let’s get people into the streets in a form of rolling mass action in response to the rolling blackouts that the government is perpetrating but also to put the blame at the doorstep, at the root cause of the problem. This is not an Eskom problem or Nersa problem, it’s an ANC problem," said Steenhuisen. On the president’s cancelled trip to Davos, spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said this was because he understands the seriousness of the load shedding situation.

He took to social media at the weekend saying there is a potential legal case for the government to answer on load shedding and its “devastating consequences” on a range of rights.
