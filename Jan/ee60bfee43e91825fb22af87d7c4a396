This added pressure on the power grid, forcing the ramping up of the power cuts. As technicians attend to the breakdowns, Eskom appealed for the spare use of electricity to preserve the current levels of limited power. “We currently have 6,014 megawatts on planned maintenance, while another 17,278 megawatts of capacity is unavailable,” said Eskom crisis communication manager Menzi Mngomezulu. Eskom said it would provide further updates on the status of the grid.
