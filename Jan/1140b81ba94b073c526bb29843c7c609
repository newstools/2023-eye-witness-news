JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congress (ANC) in Johannesburg on Friday confirmed that once negotiations with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have successfully concluded it will contest the mayoral position in the city. Last November talks between the two parties in the City of Ekurhuleni collapsed when the EFF refused to vote in support of an ANC candidate for the mayoral position. This came after Tania Campbell was ousted through an ANC-sponsored motion of no confidence but was re-elected a week later.

The ANC’s chairperson in Joburg, Dada Morero, said he will contest the Joburg mayoral position once the EFF agrees to support him in council. Meanwhile, councillors in Joburg will be electing a new mayor Friday with the candidates including Al- Jama-ah's Thapelo Amad, the Democratic Alliance's Mpho Phalatse and ActionSA's Funzi Ngobeni. The ANC wants to reclaim control of the country's economic hub, Johannesburg, while the EFF set its sights on the City of Ekurhuleni. This means the two parties will have to support each other at both metros for them to achieve their goals.
