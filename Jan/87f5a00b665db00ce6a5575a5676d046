CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo has highlighted the debilitating impact that the country’s struggling economy has on the provision of public healthcare. Mbombo on Tuesday welcomed the 2023 intake of interns and community services doctors at the country’s second biggest healthcare facility, Tygerberg Hospital.

Health MEC Mbombo explained that the tough economic times were also being felt in the sector. "It has got to do with the economy that is beyond our control. Now with our budget for the Western Cape that has been decreased for the next three years, starting from this year, it will have a huge impact, so now we're relying on the provincial treasury, at least, to be able to make it up on that aspect." Mbombo reiterated that as much as patients had rights, an environment should also be created where these doctors could carry out their duties. Provincial health officials said that 332 medical intern doctors had been placed in the province.
