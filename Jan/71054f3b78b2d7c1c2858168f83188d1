JOHANNEBSURG - Gauteng traffic police have warned motorists to avoid using the N14 highway between Krugersdorp and Pretoria due to protest action. Demonstrations are believed to be related to the removal of squatters around Diepsloot. Protesters barricaded the N14 with burning tyres and rocks in both directions on Wednesday morning. Police said vehicles passing by in the area were being stoned.
