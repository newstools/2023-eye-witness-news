The former school teacher was also wanted in the United Kingdom (UK) on similar charges. A former Rondebosch Boys' Preparatory School pupil in Cape Town, known only as Stephen, accused the man of abusing him in 1988. The former teacher was also accused of abusing dozens of boys at Edinburgh Academy, and Fettes College in Scotland, in the 1960s and 1970s. Founding director at WMACA Miranda Jordan said it was concerning that in 2019 the suspect was allowed to await his extradition ruling to the UK, at home. "Our organisation, Women and Men Against Child Abuse, remain deeply concerned that he was arrested in 2019 when he returned to South Africa, but was allowed to await his extradition outcome at home, rather than in prison."
