Police said they received information about a man dealing in drugs at the Panama House apartment building. Scores of people took to the streets on Monday, demanding answers from the police regarding the man's death.   Commissioner Street in the Joburg CBD was barricaded with burning tyres and debris at Goud Street due to protest action on 16 January 2023.

The protest left Commissioner Street in shambles, with debris still lying on the side of the road, and pieces of shattered glass scattered across the street. Cleaners have begun sweeping the glass, but say they will need the municipality to assist with the remaining debris. Meanwhile, several residents who stay at the Panama House apartment building claim the police are responsible for Monday's protest. The police say the incident is being investigated.
