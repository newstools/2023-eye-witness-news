JOHANNESBURG - As registration approaches for higher education institutions, Free State police have warned against student accommodation scams. The University of the Witwatersrand has already commenced with online registration while registration opens on Monday at the University of Johannesburg. Free State police spokesperson Mahlomola Kareli said as students travel from all parts of the country looking for accommodation for the academic year ahead, some fall victim to scammers. He urged parents and students to properly verify accommodation offers before making payment. "Police are pleading with parents and guardians not to deposit any cash into anyone's bank account before they have seen the available accommodation. This is to avoid being scammed as cases of defrauded parents were registered in previous years," he added.
