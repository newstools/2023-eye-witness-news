The organisation added that the price of fuel and electricity already made up 70% of its production costs. Energy regulator Nersa recently approved an 18.65% electricity tariff increase, which will take effect in April.

"We understand the South African consumers, they are times of peak and times of doom so we are hoping that now schools are open we are hoping now we will start to see that increase in consumption. As learners are going back to school, hopefully, the mothers will start adding eggs to the lunch boxes."
