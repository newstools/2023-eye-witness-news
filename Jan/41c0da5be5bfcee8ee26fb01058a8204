JOHANNESBURG - Former Johannesburg mayor Mpho Phalatse says she will be contesting the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) federal leader position at the party’s conference in April. Speaking to the media in Soweto, Phalatse said she believed she had the necessary leadership skills for the position. The position is currently occupied by John Steenhuisen.

Al Jama-ah's Thapelo Amad and ActionSA's Funzi Ngobeni were nominated for the mayoral position, and Amad was voted into the position during an election that took place during last Friday's council meeting. The city's new coalition government was expected to convene a special meeting this week to discuss the acquisition of a loan, amid the metro's cash flow crisis.
