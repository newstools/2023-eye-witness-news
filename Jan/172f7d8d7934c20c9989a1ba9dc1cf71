While the country recently averted a technical recession, experts predict that economic growth will continue to be muted this year. Roodt said that there would be a spillover effect. "Unemployment levels and poverty levels will remain elevated and maybe even go up even further," Roodt said. But he said that it was not all doom and gloom.
