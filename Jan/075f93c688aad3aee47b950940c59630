JOHANNESBURG - ActionSA said talks with the Democratic Alliance (DA) regarding the Patriotic Alliance (PA) have broken down, and the multi-party coalition in the City of Johannesburg will face motions of no confidence - without the majority to defend Mayor Mpho Phalatse. At the centre of the dispute appears to be an original proposal that had been agreed to by all parties, including the DA, and accepted by the PA. However, ActionSA said rather than honouring the universally accepted proposal, the DA branded the PA as corrupt. The party said that as a consequence, it seemed certain that the motions of no confidence would succeed and the coalition in Johannesburg would fall. However, ActionSA said it would field its own candidate for mayor. The DA is yet to respond. ActionSA's national chairperson, Micheal Beaumont: "This is a sad day for multi-party coalitions and for Mpho Phalatse, who we believe has been abandoned by her own party. However, ActionSA cannot allow this to go without a solution. We are working with other political parties to put forward an ActionSA candidate and the Democratic Alliance will face the decision to either support that candidate or to support the ANC."
