READ: Alleged child rape ring accused back in dock as detained prisoner For the first time since his trial began, Gerhard Ackerman made his way from the holding cells in the Johannesburg High Court without a mask and without his Muslim kufi hat. State advocate Valencia Dube read the statements from the police officers who alerted her that Ackerman had disappeared, and he had sold all his belongings. The court heard how one of the witnesses who spoke to police told them Ackerman was planning on moving to the Western Cape, and that he was looking for a gun to kill himself because he did not want to go to prison. Ackerman has taken the witness stand to give his version of events. He denied the version from the witnesses, saying he simply moved to Pretoria with a friend because he could no longer afford rent. This despite his bail conditions clearly stating he should not leave the Johannesburg metropolitan area.
