The child was raped & killed by her mother, Esther Mwenda Brown and her brother Mike Mwenda Brown in April 2021 at a hotel in Midrand @ewnreporter  It seems the mom and her brother believed the baby was demon possessed and said they took her to the hotel room to pray for her.  They took oil from home and used that to make cross signs on shiny surfaces and the mirrors. @ewnreporter  In his sentencing, Judge Ismail pointed out how the injuries inflicted on Athalia during her rape would have permanently impaired her movement, scarring her for life. During the trial, the court hard how the two-year-old was killed by torture in what was a ritual. The court noted how her mother and uncle used oil to make crucifix signs on the mirrors of the hotel room that they killed her in. The pair were convicted of two counts of rape each because of the assault inflicted both anally and vaginally on the child. They were also handed one life sentence each for the brutal murder, something that Judge Ismail has likened to the extinguishing of a candle in the rain.
